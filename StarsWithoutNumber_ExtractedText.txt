INTO THE WAITING NIGHT
Welcome, reader, to Stars Without Number, a science
fiction role-playing game. Within the pages of this
book you will find all that you require to forge mighty
tales both of victory and bitter defeat amid the silent
stars above. You will fashion heroes fit for this new
age of exploration and rediscovery, men and women
capable of unearthing the lost wonders of humanity’s
fallen empire. The scattered sectors of the old Terran
Mandate have been out of communication for centuries, and no one living can know all the strange wonders that have been born in the Silence. Every fresh
world is a new marvel to discover, and the brave souls
willing to repair the broken web of contact can expect
rich rewards for their efforts.
Stars Without Number is not only a game of discovery, however. There are adventures to be had in more
familiar places as well. New polities and young empires
have sprung up in the centuries since the collapse of the
Terran Mandate, and they struggle with each other as
hotly as their technology and resources allow. The right
hero at the right time can shift the fate of worlds, and
heroes willing to fight for their beliefs can be the greatest resources a struggling star nation possesses. There
are adventures to be had in dealing with the powers
of a stellar sector, where men and women are needed
to foil the sinister plans of enemies and bring victory.
Not every hero has a mind for high goals, however. Many desire nothing more than freedom and the
credits to enjoy it. Whether hauling cargo to backwater
worlds or selling their lasers to the highest bidder, these
mercenary adventurers go where the pay is good and
the danger is acceptable. Some have greater ideals than
their next patron’s pay, while others have no devotion
to anything but their own interest. Stars Without Number has room for both kinds of heroes, and tools to help
a game master provide the adventures they require.

A Word to Newbies
If Stars Without Number is your first tabletop
role-playing game, you’re a rare soul. Most of
the readers of this book will already be familiar
with the hobby, but fear not; tabletop RPGs aren’t
hard to understand. Just think of them as a pencil-and-paper equivalent of a computer RPG, with
a “game master” or “GM” in place of the computer,
and 2-5 players playing “player character” avatars.
You’ll need paper, pencils, and a set of polyhedral dice or a dice app to play the game. You
can get gaming dice online easily. When the book
tells you to roll “2d10+1”, for example, it means
to roll two ten-sided dice and add them together,
then add one to the result. “d00” means to roll two
10-sided dice and read them as ones and tens.

Stars Without Number is above all a set of tools
for players and game masters bent on sci-fi adventure.
While the setting is built to provide a wide scope for
daring deeds, the game is fundamentally meant to be
reshaped and refocused to suit your particular interests
and desires. Whether a gritty game of desperate mercenary gunmen in an interstellar war zone or a dashing
campaign of star-faring adventurers in a space-operatic
sector, the game is meant to fit the needs and tone of
your desired play.
Stars Without Number belongs to the “old-school
renaissance” trend in gaming, and draws much of its
mechanical inspiration from the classic games of the
seventies and the work of such authors as Gary Gygax,
Tom Moldvay, Zeb Cook, Marc Miller, and other luminaries of those days. While many people now prefer
different mechanical frameworks for their play, these
“old-school” rules are understood by a tremendous
number of gamers and form a convenient lingua franca
between many different OSR games. These games are
usually broadly compatible with each other, and allow
players to loot material from many different authors
and time periods with limited effort at conversion.
This game is also designed to be a “sandbox game”,
one built to ease the creation of active, living campaign
worlds where the PCs aren’t the only important figures,
and where a hero doesn’t necessarily have any narrative
armor against failure and death. While it can certainly
be played in a more conventional adventure path or
story-arc manner, Stars Without Number is stocked
with a wide range of tools, techniques, and guidelines
for easing sandbox play. The surprise and freshness
inherent in a good sandbox game can be a refreshing
change of pace for many groups, and in this book you’ll
find what you need to play in that style.
The book you hold in hand right now is the revised edition of the original 2010 version of the game.
In compiling the revision, I have been careful to keep it
compatible with the existing material for the game, so
you should be able to use original edition supplements
with minimal fuss. Rather than changing the bones of
the system, I have instead added additional material to
help GMs and entertain players, expanding the scope
of the game. If you are reading the free PDF version of
this game, you will find everything you need for a full
campaign in these pages. If you have the deluxe version
in hand, you will find almost a hundred pages of bonus
content to supply you with tools for transhuman scifi campaigns, space-operatic heroes, stellar wizardry,
mechs, artificial intelligences, and tools for building
sci-fi societies.
Above all, Stars Without Number is your game now.
There is no one “correct” way to play it. There is only
your way to play it, and you should feel free to make it
the game you want to play.

CHARACTER CREATION
Before you can begin playing Stars Without Number,
you need to roll up a character. While the game can
theoretically work with just a single player and a GM,
things work best with 2–5 friends in addition to the
GM. A lone adventurer can get in a lot of trouble out
there, and a small group can find it hard to include all
the different skills and talents that are often required
to survive a sticky situation.
With that in mind, you and the others in your
gaming group should give a little thought to making
characters that work well together. Grim loners make
good book protagonists, but they don’t survive well
when there’s no author around to bail them out.
When making a character, some players like to
simply throw the dice and see where they lead. Others
prefer to know a little more about the game world and
like to have more detail provided beforehand about the
worlds and themes of the game. For those who’d prefer
a more detailed discussion of the world of Stars Without
Number, you can skip ahead to page 120 and read up on
it there. For the rest of you…

What Players Need To Know

Your character is an adventurer in the year 3200, a
dweller among the scattered worlds of a great human
diaspora. For whatever reason, he or she has decided
to leave their old life behind and take up a starfaring
existence, daring perils and seeking new frontiers in
search of glory, riches, or their own personal ambitions.
Many worlds have recovered from the desperation of the centuries-long Silence, and can once again
manufacture spacecraft and other advanced technology.
Other worlds are “lost worlds”, still cut off from interstellar trade and forced to make do with the resources
of their own planet. Lostworlders are often considered
barbaric by technologically advanced worlds.
Tramp freighters, small merchant ships, and scout
craft serve most worlds, even the most backward. If
your character comes from a primitive or isolated culture, it’s probable that he or she hitched a ride aboard
such a ship to travel to a more cosmopolitan life. It may
or may not have been a voluntary choice.
In actual play, your character should be motivated
to act, and to act as part of a group. The game does
not deal well with hostile loners, apathetic brooders, or
other characters that have to be coaxed into engaging
with the world and cooperating with the rest of the
group. The world of Stars Without Number is dangerous, and characters who cringe from peril or insist on
facing it alone will find only boredom or an early grave.
Every character should have a goal from the very
start. This might be something as simple as “become
wealthy beyond my fondest dreams of avarice” or “be
known as the greatest pilot in the sector”. It might be
as elaborate as “engineer the downfall of the interstellar

empire that conquered my world”. Whatever it is, it
should give your character an immediate reason to go
out and do something.
This will to act is especially crucial in Stars Without Number, because this game is designed to support
a “sandbox” style of gaming. Unlike many other games
that encourage the development of a particular story
or the playing out of a specific plot line, Stars Without
Number presents an entire interstellar sector to your
characters and invites you to choose for yourself how
to experience it. Stories will arise based on what your
characters do and how they respond to the adventure
situations provided by the GM.
As a player, you need to cooperate with your GM.
This doesn’t necessarily mean following every lead and
hook you’re given without demurral, but it does mean
that you need to respond to the situations and possibilities that are given to you.
You also need to keep in mind that your adventurers exist in a very large world that is not scaled to
your characters’ abilities. If you insist on throwing your
characters into situations or challenges that seem overwhelming, the odds are that they will overwhelm you.
Scouting, reconnaissance, and careful intelligence gathering will help you recognize no-win situations before
you push ahead into them. By the same token, don’t
hesitate to flee if your party appears to be facing certain
doom. A keen sense of when to decamp the field is
often an experienced adventurer’s most valuable asset.

Rolling a Character
Stars Without Number belongs to a somewhat older
tradition in tabletop RPGs, one where characters
aren’t so much “built” as they are “rolled”. Players
often don’t know who exactly they’re going to be
playing in a campaign, and rely on random rolls to
determine a hero’s aptitudes and skills. Part of the
pleasure of the game is throwing these new-rolled
cyphers into play and exploring their personalities
and motivations directly through the events of the
adventures they undertake.
In most modern games, however, a player
expects to be able to create exactly the kind of PC
they’ve envisioned before the campaign begins.
They don’t want to rely on random rolls to give
them the character they’re going to be playing.
This is a perfectly valid preference, and players who want to have full control over creating
their hero can do so with an attribute array and
skills picked from a selected background. Even
so, players without strong feelings on the matter
might find it refreshing to let their hero’s past be
discovered by the unpredictable chance of the dice.

4• Summary of Character Creation

A Summary of Character Creation
For your convenience, here’s a quick summary of the
character creation process. Experienced players can
simply go down the list to generate their next interstellar freebooter, while those new to the game can use it as
a guide reference as they go through the steps detailed
on the following pages. A blank character sheet can be
found at the end of the book.
Note that some steps indicate that you should roll
or pick skills, as described on page 7. The first time you
roll or pick a skill, it starts at level-0. The second time,
it becomes level-1. The third time, you can instead pick
any other non-psychic skill of your choice that’s less
than level-1. No novice hero’s skills can exceed level-1
during character creation.
1.

Roll your six attributes or assign them from an
array, using Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Attributes
reflect the basic potential of your hero. Roll 3d6
six times and assign them in order, or use an
array of 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7 assigned as you wish.
If you randomly roll your scores you may then
pick one attribute to change to a score of 14.

2.

Mark down your attribute modifiers for each
score. When rolling dice that are affected by an
attribute, you don’t apply the whole score; instead, you apply the attribute modifier. A score
of 3 is a -2, 4—7 is a -1, 8—13 is no modifier,
14—17 is +1, and 18 is +2.

3.

Pick a background from the list on page 9, one
that most closely reflects your hero’s past experiences. You gain the skill listed under the
background name at level-0, which equates to
an ordinary working knowledge of it.

4.

Decide whether to roll for additional skills or
pick them. If you pick skills, you can choose two
more skills from the Learning table for your
background, with the exception of entries that
say “Any Skill”, which you may not pick. You
cannot pick entries from the Growth table. If
you’re not sure what to pick, just take the “Quick
Skills” listed for your background at level-0,
which include your background’s beginning skill.

5.

If you choose to roll for your skills, you can roll up
to three times, dividing up your rolls between
the Growth and Learning tables as you wish.
When you roll on the Growth table, some results may say “+2 Physical” or “+2 Mental”. In
the former case, you can add two points to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, or one
point to two different stats. In the latter case,

you can add two points to either Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma, or divide the bonus between two of them.
6.

Choose your class, representing those talents
you have that are most relevant to an adventurer’s lifestyle. If your hero isn’t well-described
by Warrior, Expert, or Psychic, you can choose
Adventurer and mix your class abilities.

7.

Choose your foci, representing the side talents
or particular specializations of your hero. You
can pick one level of a focus of your choice.
Characters with the Expert class or the Partial
Expert feature of the Adventurer class get one
level of a non-combat, non-psychic focus for
free in addition to this. They can spend both
levels on the same focus, starting with level 2
in it if they wish. Characters with the Warrior
class or Partial Warrior feature of the Adventurer class can do the same in choosing one level of
a combat focus.

8.

Optionally, if your GM is allowing alien PCs or
VI or True AI PCs, you can make your character
into one such creature by spending your focus
level on the appropriate origin focus. Aliens and
VIs are described in the Xenobestiary chapter,
starting on page 192, while True AIs are part
of the deluxe Stars Without Number core book,
starting on page 280.

9.

Now pick one non-psychic skill of your choice to
reflect your hero’s outside interests, natural talents, hobby expertise, or other personal focus.

10.

If you’ve chosen the Psychic class or chosen to be
an Adventurer with the Partial Psychic ability,
you are a psychic PC, with powers described
in the following section, starting on page 28.
Psychics can pick two psychic skills from those
listed on page 8, while Partial Psychics can pick
one. If a Psychic picks the same skill twice, they
get it at level-1 expertise, and can pick a free
level-1 technique from those listed for that discipline. Both Psychics and Partial Psychics get
the level-0 abilities associated with their skills,
as described under each discipline they possess.
Both also have a maximum Effort score equal to
1 plus their highest psychic skill plus the better of
their Wisdom or Constitution modifiers.

11.

Roll your maximum hit points on 1d6, adding
your Constitution modifier. Even a penalty can’t
reduce your hit points below 1. Warrior PCs

Record your Armor Class, the measure of how

order to hurt your PC, an enemy has to roll an
attack roll on a d20, adding their attack bonus
and equaling or exceeding your Armor Class.

17.

Note down your beginning saving throw scores
for your Physical, Evasion, and Mental saving
throws. Physical saves against poison, disease,
or exhaustion are 15 minus the best of your
Strength or Constitution modifiers. Evasion
saves to dodge sudden perils or dive away from
explosives are 15 minus the best of your Intelligence and Dexterity modifiers. Mental saves to
resist psychic influence or mind-bending technology are 15 minus the best of your Wisdom or
Charisma modifiers. To resist these perils, you
need to equal or beat the save on a d20.

18.

Lastly, wrap up your PC with a name and a goal.
Every hero needs to have a goal when they set
out adventuring. This goal might change, but
your PC should always have some reason to go
out and interact with the world before them.
Stay-at-home PCs and those unwilling to dare
greatly for their aims are rarely fun to play.

6• Attributes

Attributes
The first step in creating a character is to determine
the character’s six attributes. Attributes describe how
strong, quick, clever, perceptive, hardy, or charming
your hero might be. Attributes are measured by scores
ranging from 3 to 18, with 3 reflecting an attribute
so weak that the PC is barely fit for adventuring and
an 18 marking the maximum possible aptitude for an
ordinary human.
To generate a character’s attributes, roll 3d6 six
times and assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You may then change one attribute of your choice
to 14 if you wish to ensure that your new adventurer
is gifted in at least one way.
If you prefer not to roll, you may instead assign
the following scores to your attributes in any order you
wish: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7. If you assign your scores,
you cannot replace one of them with a 14.
Once you’ve assigned your attributes, record the
modifier for each of them. This modifier is applied to
relevant skill checks or other rolls related to the attribute. If your attribute score changes during play, either from some crippling injury or from improvements
granted by your background or experience, you should
make sure to update any changed modifier.

Rolling a PC’s Attributes
Simon’s rolling up a character for a new campaign.
The first step is to figure out what kind of hero he’s
going to be playing in the upcoming game, and that
means determining attributes.
If Simon had a particular concept he knew he
wanted to play, choosing to use the array might be
a good idea. It provides a predictable set of numbers
he can put in whatever order he wishes, and unless
his concept requires that his PC be particularly gifted
in more than one attribute, the 14 that’s part of the
array would ensure that he was capable in whatever
natural aptitude was most important to the concept.
On the other hand, even if he rolls the dice, he
knows his hero is going to be good at something. He
can put that free 14 in any attribute he wishes, so if
all he cares about is making sure his PC is quick, he
can rest assured that random rolling will still produce a quick PC.
Simon, however, really doesn’t have any particular concept he knows he wants to play for this campaign. He decides he’s going to let the dice determine
what kind of hero he’s going to play. Letting the dice
make the decision helps him break out of any ruts he
might be in when it comes to character concepts, and
it can make him consider ideas that might be fresher
in play than his usual fare.

Simon takes three six-sided dice in hand and
rolls them six times, assigning each number in order
to his Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores. His results are 10, 4,
13, 16, 8, and 7.
Since 10 or 11 is an average human score, Simon
can see that this PC has a very considerable intellect counterbalanced by pronounced clumsiness and
poor social skills. Because he rolled his statistics, he
can replace one of the rolls with a score of 14. After
some consideration, Simon decides that swapping
out his bad Dexterity score makes the most sense.
Now Simon notes down the attribute modifiers for each of his scores: a Strength of 10 is +0, a
Dexterity of 14 is +1, a Constitution of 13 is +0, an
Intelligence of 16 is +1, a Wisdom of 8 is +0, and a
Charisma of 7 is -1.
When rolling skill checks, attack rolls, or other
things modified by an attribute, Simon will be using
the modifier rather than the full attribute score. The
scores themselves might change a little due to his
hero’s background or future personal training, but
mostly they’ll serve as cues for playing the PC. With
a Wisdom of 8, for example, Simon’s hero might not
have a penalty to rolls, but he probably makes the
occasional decision he lives to regret.

Skills •7

Skills
Your hero’s learned capabilities are skills, and every
star-faring adventurer has their share of them. A hero
can usually attempt to do anything, whether it’s to
climb a sun-scorched cliff on an alien world, talk down
an enraged lostworlder warlord, or fire a mag rifle at
a charging xenomorph, but having the right skill can
make a vast difference in results.
Skills are measured in a rating from level-0 for
competent practitioners to level-4 for the best in the
sector. Novice heroes start with level-0 or level-1 in
their skills. You’ll choose or roll skills in the next section, when you select a background for your character.
Skill Level
Level-0

Basic competence in the skill, such as
an ordinary practitioner would have

Level-1

An experienced professional in the
skill, clearly better than most

Level-2

Veteran expert, one respected even
by those with considerable experience

Level-3

Master of the skill, likely one of the
best on the planet

Level-4

Superlative expertise, one of the best
in the entire stellar sector.

Skill Checks

Your hero is assumed to be competent at all the ordinary functions of their role and background. If he’s a
moisture farmer from a back-of-nowhere desert world,
he’s going to know how to keep a dew still running and
how to put on a coolsuit. If she’s a corporate magnate’s
succession-groomed daughter from a megacorp-dominated hiveworld, she’s going to know how to read a
balance sheet and speak during a meeting with C-level
executives. They will never fail at these basic tasks unless some situation makes them much harder than usual.
Sometimes, however, the hero will be faced with
a situation outside their usual experience, or will try
to accomplish a normal task while under considerable
strain or disadvantage. In those cases, you’ll need to
roll a skill check.
To roll a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most
applicable attribute modifier and skill level. If the total
is equal or greater than the difficulty of the check, you
succeed. If less, something goes wrong, or you fail outright in the attempt, or something unexpected happens.
If you haven’t even got level-0 in the relevant skill
you take a -1 penalty to the roll. Some particularly technical or difficult feats might not be achievable at all
without some grounding in the skill.

8• Attributes

The Skill List

The following skills are standard choices for most campaigns. Games set in unusual reaches of space or unique
settings might alter this list.
Skills are general, and some of them may overlap
in some situations. A hero trying to clear a jammed disruptor cannon before the aliens break through the door
might plausibly check either Fix to repair it or Shoot to
represent their familiarity with weapons maintenance.
Assuming the GM agrees, you can roll whichever skill
is better for you.
Administer: Manage an organization, handle paperwork, analyze records, and keep an institution
functioning on a daily basis. Roll it for bureaucratic expertise, organizational management, legal knowledge, dealing with government agencies,
and understanding how institutions really work.
Connect: Find people who can be helpful to your purposes and get them to cooperate with you. Roll
it to make useful connections with others, find
people you know, know where to get illicit goods
and services, and be familiar with foreign cultures
and languages. You can use it in place of Talk for
persuading people you find via this skill.
Exert: Apply trained speed, strength, or stamina in
some feat of physical exertion. Roll it to run, jump,
lift, swim, climb, throw, and so forth. You can use
it as a combat skill when throwing things, though
it doesn’t qualify as a combat skill for other ends.
Fix: Create and repair devices both simple and complex.
How complex will depend on your character’s
background; a lostworlder blacksmith is going to
need some study time before he’s ready to fix that
broken fusion reactor, though he can do it eventually. Roll it to fix things, build things, and identify
what something is supposed to do.
Heal: Employ medical and psychological treatment for
the injured or disturbed. Roll it to cure diseases,
stabilize the critically injured, treat psychological
disorders, or diagnose illnesses.
Know: Know facts about academic or scientific fields.
Roll it to understand planetary ecologies, remember relevant history, solve science mysteries, and
know the basic facts about rare or esoteric topics.
Lead: Convince others to also do whatever it is you’re
trying to do. Talk might persuade them that following you is smart, but Lead can make them do
it even when they think it’s a bad idea. Roll it to
lead troops in combat, convince others to follow
you, or maintain morale and discipline.
Notice: Spot anomalies or interesting facts about your
environment. Roll it for searching places, detecting ambushes, spotting things, and reading the
emotional state of other people.
Perform: Exhibit some performative skill. Roll it to
dance, sing, orate, act, or otherwise put on a convincing or emotionally moving performance.

Pilot: Use this skill to pilot vehicles or ride beasts. Roll
it to fly spaceships, drive vehicles, ride animals,
or tend to basic vehicle repair. This skill doesn’t
help you with things entirely outside the scope
of your background or experience, though with
some practice a PC can expand their expertise.
Program: Operating or hacking computing and communications hardware. Roll it to program or hack
computers, control computer-operated hardware,
operate communications tech, or decrypt things.
Punch: Use it as a combat skill when fighting unarmed.
If your PC means to make a habit of this rather
than as a recourse of desperation, you should take
the Unarmed Fighter focus described later.
Shoot: Use it as a combat skill when using ranged weaponry, whether hurled rocks, bows, laser pistols,
combat rifles, or ship’s gunnery.
Sneak: Move without drawing notice. Roll it for stealth,
disguise, infiltration, manual legerdemain, pickpocketing, and the defeat of security measures.
Stab: Use it as a combat skill when wielding melee
weapons, whether primitive or complex.
Survive: Obtain the basics of food, water, and shelter
in hostile environments, along with avoiding their
natural perils. Roll it to handle animals, navigate
difficult terrain, scrounge urban resources, make
basic tools, and avoid wild beasts or gangs.
Talk: Convince other people of the facts you want them
to believe. What they do with that conviction may
not be completely predictable. Roll it to persuade,
charm, or deceive others in conversation.
Trade: Find what you need on the market and sell what
you have. Roll it to sell or buy things, figure out
where to purchase hard-to-get or illicit goods, deal
with customs agents, or run a business.
Work: This is a catch-all skill for professions not represented by other skills. Roll it to work at a particular
profession, art, or trade.

Psychic Skills

Unlike other skills, psychic skills are restricted to characters with the Psychic class or the Partial Psychic class
option for Adventurers. You cannot choose or roll
these skills in character creation unless specifically told
to pick a psychic skill.
Biopsionics: Master powers of physical repair, body augmentation, and shapeshifting.
Metapsionics: Master powers that nullify, boost, and
shape the use of other psychic abilities.
Precognition: Master the ability to sense future events
and control probability.
Telekinesis: Master the remote control of kinetic energy
to move objects and fabricate force constructs.
Telepathy: Master the reading and influencing of other
sapient minds.
Teleportation: Master the arts of physical translocation
of yourself and allies.

Choosing a Background
It’s unlikely that your character sprang forth full-grown
from the endless depths of space, so it’s probable that he
or she had some sort of background before adventuring
and some kind of training in a field suitable for the life
of an interstellar wayfarer. Of course, the call of adventure is somewhat indiscriminate, and some people from
very unlikely walks of life might find themselves hurled
into the potentially-lethal excitement of deep space. To
determine your hero’s past training, you need to choose
or roll a background.
A background is simply a thumbnail description
of the kind of life your hero lived before they took up
adventuring. It may not have been the only thing they
did with their life, but it’s the thing that taught them
most of their existing skills.
When you’ve chosen or rolled your background,
take a moment to think about your character’s past.
Decide how your character came to take up that profession, and what made them put it down to follow a
more adventurous lifestyle. Did they do it for excitement? Friendship? Money? Or were they just running
from a situation they couldn’t handle?
You will also want to pick a homeworld for your
PC. Your GM can give you some suggestions for worlds
in their campaign that would fit your character concept,
or you might simply make up your own homeworld or
native space habitat with the GM’s permission, as you
might be from some far-distant sector of space.
Twenty backgrounds are provided on the following pages. You may roll randomly to see where your
hero comes from, or pick one that suits you. If none of
the backgrounds appeal to you, you can simply describe
your hero’s prior life to the GM and pick any three
skills that fit that past.

Training Skills and Attributes

When your character is allowed to pick or roll a skill,
you learn it at level-0 expertise the first time you receive it. If you receive it a second time, it becomes level-1. If some mechanic or skill choice allows or obliges
you to pick it a third time, you can instead choose any
non-psychic skill in its place. The only way to raise
psychic skills during character creation is via special
abilities or foci that specifically boost them. No starting
character can begin with a skill level higher than level-1.
Sometimes you’re allowed to pick “Any Skill”. This
means you can choose any non-psychic skill to improve.
Other entries that read “Any Combat” mean that you
can pick either Stab, Shoot, or Punch as you choose.
You cannot raise psychic skills with “Any Skill” picks.
Rolls on the Growth table that improve your basic
attributes can boost them up to a maximum of 18. A
bonus that applies to “Any Stat” can be applied to any
attribute. If the roll says to add the bonus to Physical attributes, you can add the bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. If the roll says to add a bonus
to your Mental attributes, you can apply the points to
either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If the bonus
is +2, you may split the points between two different
attributes of the appropriate type if you wish.

Backgrounds, Skills, and Growth

Once you pick a background, your hero gains several
skills associated with their past.
First, you get the free skill associated with the
background. Every member of that role or profession
needs this skill to function competently, so your hero
gets it as well.
Next, you may either pick two other skills from
the Learning table for your background, or make three
random rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables. If you pick skills, you can select exactly the
talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows your character a little wider range of
competence and the option of attribute improvements
at the cost of perfect control over their development. If
you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if you
wish, to improve its starting proficiency.
If you’re not sure what to pick, just take the three
skills listed under “Quick Skills” for your background.
They’re the ones most critical to the profession.

Barbarian

Standards of barbarism vary when many worlds
are capable of interstellar spaceflight, but your
hero comes from a savage world of low technology
and high violence. Their planet may have survived
an all-consuming war, or been deprived of critical
materials or energy resources, or simply have been
colonized by confirmed Luddites. Other barbarians
might be drawn from the impoverished underclass
of advanced worlds or the technologically-degenerate inheritors of some high-tech space station or
planetary hab.

Clergy

Faith is nigh-universal among human civilizations,
and your hero is dedicated to one such belief. Some
clergy are conventional priests or priestesses, while
others might be cloistered monastics or nuns, or
more martial warrior-monks. Modern-day faiths
such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism,
Buddhism, and other creeds all exist in various sectors, often in altered form, while some worlds have
developed entirely new deities or faiths. If you’d like
to create your own religion, you can work with the
GM to define its characteristic beliefs.

Building a Background for a PC
Simon’s got his hero’s attributes set, but those are just
part of making a character. He also needs to figure
out where this hero came from, and what kind of
life they’ve led before they took up the mantle of an
adventuring existence.
If he had a particular preference for a background, he could simply pick one of the list on page
9. If none of those fit, he could just write down a
few sentences about the background he did want and
pick three skills that fit it, assuming the GM agreed
it made sense, or rolled on the existing background
tables that best fit their custom past. But Simon is
still uncertain about the nature of his hero, so he
decides to roll randomly for a background.
He gets a 15, so his hero is a scholar. As a scholar,
he automatically gets the Know skill at level-0, and
needs to decide what kind of scholar he is. Simon
considers his options and decides to go with something he knows; his PC is a literature post-doc by the
name of Basil Hayes.
Simon decides that Basil should continue with
his random rolling rather than just choosing two
more skills from the Learning table for a scholar.
Because he chooses to randomly roll, he can make
three rolls, splitting them as he wishes between the
Learning or the Growth table.

His first roll is on the Growth table, and it
comes up “+2 Mental”. He immediately puts it into
Intelligence, raising the score to 18 and giving it a +2
modifier instead of +1. Basil is a brilliant man.
His second roll he makes on the Learning table,
and it comes up “Know”. He already has Know at
level-0, so now he gets Know-1. His third roll comes
up “Talk”, giving him Talk-0.
A brief view of Basil’s history shows him as a
brilliant young scholar with a keenly refined mind,
an excellent grasp of intellectual topics, and enough
glibness to get through a thesis defense. Simon decides that Basil’s occasional fits of social ineptitude
have torpedoed his career in academia, however, and
have forced him out into the world to make a living
as an interstellar freebooter.
Simon also needs to pick a homeworld for Basil.
While he could ask the GM for a list of likely places,
he decides that Basil hails from the cold and inhospitable world of Karelia, a planet that relies mostly on
trading the long-duty service contracts of its citizens
to other, wealthier worlds in exchange for vital tech.
The GM thinks that Karelia sounds like the sort of
world that would fit in the campaign, and so allows
it. Simon can make up any other details of the world
that are needed as the campaign plays out.

backgrounds •11

Courtesan

Your hero’s career was one of proffered pleasure.
Simple prostitution is one form of this background,
perhaps as an ordinary streetwalker, a part-time
amateur with bills to pay, or an expensive companion to the wealthy, but other forms of satisfaction exist among the many worlds. Refined artists
of conversation and grace command high fees in
some societies, while others pay well for the simple company of certain men and women with the
right bloodlines, special appearance, or auspicious
personal qualities esteemed by their culture.

Criminal

Whether thief, murderer, forger, smuggler, spy, or

criminal. Some such rogues are guilty only of crossing some oppressive government or offending a
planetary lord, while others have done things that
no civilized society could tolerate. Still, their ability
to deal with the most desperate and dangerous of
contacts and navigate the perils of a less-than-legal
adventure can make them attractive associates for a
party of freebooters bent on profit and glory more
than strict legality.

but spent their formative years in travel, socializing,
and a series of engaging hobbies. They might have
been the scion of a wealthy industrialist, a planetary
noble’s younger offspring, or a hanger-on to someone with the money and influence they lacked. By
the time your hero’s adventures start, they’ve run
through the money that once fueled their lifestyle.
Extreme measures may be necessary to acquire further funding.

Your hero was a dedicated entertainer, one likely
focused in a particular form of art. Patrons and
talent scouts can be temperamental, however, and
sometimes a budding artist needs to take steps to
find their audience. Or at least, to find their audience’s money.

Merchant

Your hero was or is a trader. Some merchants are
mere peddlers and shopkeepers on primitive, lowtech worlds, while others are daring far traders
who venture to distant worlds to bring home their
alien treasures. The nature of trade varies widely
among worlds. On some of them, it’s a business of
soberly-dressed men and women ticking off trades
on virtual terminals, while on others it is a more…
active pursuit, requiring the judicious application of
monoblades and deniable gunfire against competitors. Sometimes a deal goes bad or capital needs
to be raised, and a merchant’s natural talents are
turned toward the perils of adventure.

Noble

Many planets are ruled by a class of nobles, and your

planets are often worlds of exquisite courtesy alloyed with utterly remorseless violence, and a misplaced word at the morning levee can result in an
executioner’s monoblade at noon. Your hero has
done something or been the victim of something to
dislodge them from their comfortable place at court.
Without their familiar allies, wealth, or influence,
they must take a new place in the world, however
distasteful that claiming might be.

inspectors. However necessary the work may be,
it is often of unendurably tedious nature, and any
man or woman with an adventurous spark to their
blood will soon find themselves desperate for more
exciting use of their talents.

Peasant

A technologically-advanced world can usually produce all its necessary foodstuffs and basic resources
with a handful of workers, the bulk of the labor being performed by agricultural bots. On more primitive worlds, or those with a natural environment
that requires close personal attention to crops, a
class of peasants will emerge. These men and women often become chattel, part and parcel of the land
they occupy and traded among their betters like the
farm equipment of richer worlds. Your hero was
not satisfied with that life, and has done something
to break free from their muddy and toilsome past.

this career might reflect a long-haul trucker, or a

deal more ceremonial combat, appeals to councils
of elders, and success at ritual trials. Whatever the

culture. Something went wrong, though, and the
only way to fix it is to get clear of your constituents for a while and seek some alternative means

Work

Worker

Countless in number, every industrialized world
has swarms of workers to operate the machines and
perform the labor that keeps society functioning.
Cooks, factory laborers, mine workers, personal
servants, lawyers, clerks, and innumerable other
roles are covered under this career. If your hero
rolls or picks Work as a skill but has a career that
would better fit another existing skill, they may substitute it accordingly. Thus, a wage-slave programmer might take Program instead of Work, while a
lawyer would use Administer instead as a reflection
of their litigious talent.

Character Classes
In one way or another, your character is cut out for
adventure. Your hero might be a veteran combatant,
skilled with blade or laser, or they might be a psychic
gifted with uncanny abilities. It’s just as possible that
they could have remarkable talents as a pilot, or be
the smoothest grifter in the hive-slum they grew up
in. Whatever their particular background, your hero’s
primary focus is their class.
Your class represents your hero’s best set of tools
for dealing with their problems. They’re the skills and
capabilities that they’re most likely to turn to to resolve
a problem, but not their only tools. A Psychic can still
shoot a gun and a Warrior can try to fast-talk a mark.
Choosing a class helps ensure that your hero is
good at something that might contribute to a bold party
of interstellar adventurers. Experts always have a knack
at exercising non-combat skills, Warriors are always
good in a scrap, and Psychics always have a unique
power or two to employ at need. Your hero might have
led a quiet life as a starport customs clerk until recently,
but their natural talents will ensure that they can do
something that the rest of the group will find useful.
In the same vein, you don’t have to choose a class
that “naturally” fits with your background. That starport customs clerk might have led a peaceful life un-

troubled by anything worse than portside brawls, but
inside her burns a seething, latent fury that is ready to
explode at the first opportunity. She’s a Warrior, even
though she might not realize her talents until the first
time she snatches up a dropped laser rifle and unleashes
a barrage of death on a pack of alien warbeasts. You
should pick whatever class for your hero that matches
the kind of play you want to have with them.
There are four possible classes you can choose for
your hero: Adventurer, Expert, Psychic, and Warrior.
Experts are PCs that rely on non-combat skills such as
stealth, persuasion, technical expertise, piloting skills,
vast learning, or personal connections. Psychics are
those rare men and women affected by Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome, ones capable of channeling these metadimensional energies to perform
feats of telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and other
psionic disciplines. Warriors are hardened combatants,
skilled in the arts of war and violent conflict, and Adventurers include those with a mix of talents and abilities, ones who don’t fit well into one of the other classes.
Choose a class that best fits your character’s concept. If Expert, Psychic, or Warrior don’t fit your image
of your hero, or if you want to customize their abilities,
you can choose the Adventurer class.

Character Classes •17

Expert
Your hero is exceptionally good at a useful skill. Doctors, cat burglars, starship pilots, grifters, technicians,
or any other concept that focuses on expertise in a
non-combat skill should pick the Expert class. Experts
are the best at such skills and gain more of them than
other classes do.
Just as a Warrior can be relied upon to make a
shot when the chips are down, an Expert has a knack
for succeeding at the moments of greatest importance.
Once per scene, an Expert can reroll a failed skill check,
taking the new result if it’s better. This benefit can be
applied to any skill check, even those that the Expert
isn’t specially focused in. Their natural talent bleeds
over into everything they do.
In their chosen field, however, the Expert is exceptionally gifted. Aside from the free focus level that all
PCs get at the start of the game, an Expert can choose
an additional level in a non-combat focus related to
their background. They can spend both of these levels
on the same focus if they wish, thus starting the game
with level 2 in that particular knack.

Class Abilities

Every Expert PC has certain special abilities.
•

You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your background. Most concepts will take
Specialist in their main skill, though Diplomat, Starfarer, Healer, or some other focus might suit better.
You may not take a combat-oriented focus with
this perk. In case of uncertainty, the GM decides
whether or not a focus is permitted.

•

Once per scene, you can reroll a failed skill check,
taking the new roll if it’s better.

•

When you advance an experience level, you
gain a bonus skill point that can be spent on any
non-combat, non-psychic skill. You can save this
point to spend later if you wish.

Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and
add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit
point. Your attack bonus is equal to half your character
level, rounded down, so it’s +0 at first level.

Psychic
Your hero has received training in controlling their natural Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome, and can
wield the psychic powers that come from that strange
affliction. Controlling and developing psychic abilities
is an extremely demanding process but allows for feats
wholly impossible to ordinary men and women.
Psychics are extremely rare in the general population. Averages vary with worlds, but most range from
one in ten thousand to one in a hundred thousand who
have the MES condition that make them amenable to
psychic training. Some of these go their entire lives
without realizing their capabilities. Others end up exploiting their native abilities without training, almost
inevitably ending up seriously brain-damaged or crazed
by the effects of unmediated metadimensional energy.
Your hero has been fortunate enough to find a psychic academy or other training institution capable of
molding and directing these abilities. They may have
come to this later in life, or been recruited young by a
society that carefully watches for MES symptoms.
Some societies deal with their psychics more generously than others. On some worlds, psychic powers
are accepted and their possessors can look forward to
lucrative and respected employment. On others, fear of
these uncanny powers and memories of the horrors of
the Scream lead to less welcoming treatment.

Class Abilities

Every Psychic PC has certain special abilities.
•

Unlike Warriors or Experts, you are capable of
learning psychic disciplines and their associated
techniques, as described starting on page 28.

•

When you pick this class, choose any two psychic
skills as bonus skills. You can pick the same one
twice to obtain level-1 proficiency in it and a free
level-1 technique from that discipline.

•

You have an Effort score, which can be used to
fuel psychic abilities. Your maximum Effort is
equal to 1 plus your highest psychic skill plus the
better of your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers. Even with a penalty, your maximum Effort
cannot be lower than 1.

Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and
add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit
point. Your attack bonus is equal to half your character
level, rounded down, so it’s +0 at first level.

18• Character Classes

Warrior
Whether a hiveworld thug, barbarian lostworlder,
gengineered combat hominid, or a natural-born killer wasting their potential in a desk job, your hero has
a real talent for inflicting mayhem. Combat in Stars
Without Number is extremely dangerous, but your hero
has the talents to survive situations that would kill a
less martial adventurer.
As a gifted purveyor of violence, you get to pick
an extra combat-related focus associated with your
special brand of havoc. While a character of any class
can take these special combat talents, you get this additional pick and a better natural hit bonus than heroes
of other classes.
Most importantly, however, Warriors have an uncanny gift for making a shot when a hit is desperately
needed, or dodging a bullet when their life is on the
line. Once per scene, a Warrior can either automatically negate a successful combat hit they just received,
taking no damage from it, or else they can turn one
of their own missed attack rolls into an automatic hit.
This versatility makes Warriors exceptionally dangerous enemies in a one-on-one fight, and significantly
more likely to survive the gory chaos of a general melee.

Class Abilities

Every Warrior PC has certain special abilities.
•

You gain a free level in a combat-related focus associated with your background. The GM decides
if a focus qualifies if it’s an ambiguous case.

•

Warriors are lucky in combat. Once per scene, as
an Instant ability, you can either choose to negate a successful attack roll against you or turn a
missed attack roll you made into a successful hit.
You can use this ability after the dice are rolled,
but it cannot be used against environmental damage, effects without an attack roll, or hits on a
vehicle you’re occupying.

•

You gain two extra maximum hit points at each
character level.

Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6+2
and add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of
1 hit point. Your attack bonus is equal to your character
level so it is +1 at first level.

Adventurer
The Adventurer class is the catch-all for heroes who
don’t fit so neatly into the other three categories. Perhaps your mercenary spent her girlhood at a psychic
academy, or maybe your combat medic knows more
about using a laser rifle than most physicians do. You
can use the Adventurer class to customize your hero’s
abilities, trading focus for wider versatility.
Adventurers split their focus between different
spheres, gaining weaker versions of each class’ benefits. For example, an Adventurer who is a psionic
warrior-adept might have considerable powers of
telekinetic force and a brutal expertise at bare-handed
combat, but they won’t have access to the wider psionic
potential of an unrestricted Psychic or the death-defying combat luck of a hardened Warrior.
To define your Adventurer’s abilities, pick two of
the following three partial classes.

Partial Expert

You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to
your background. Most concepts will take Specialist,
though Diplomat, Starfarer, Healer, or some other focus
might suit better. Gain an extra skill point every time
you gain a character level which can be spent on any
non-psychic, non-combat skill.

Partial Psychic

You are a restricted psychic. Pick one psychic discipline
as a bonus skill at level-0. You can improve this skill
with foci or skill points gained from advancing a level,
but you cannot learn or improve any other psychic skill.
Your maximum Effort equals 1 plus this psychic skill’s
level plus the best of your Wisdom or Constitution
modifiers, down to a minimum of 1.

Partial Warrior

You gain a free level in a combat focus related to your
background. Gain +1 to your attack bonus at first and
fifth levels. Gain 2 extra maximum hit points each level.
Thus, at first level, you’d roll 1d6+2 for your maximum
hit points. At second, you’d roll 2d6+4, and so forth.

Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and
add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit
point. Adventurers who’ve taken the Partial Warrior
option add 2 hit points to their maximum.
The base attack bonus for Adventurers is equal to
half their character level, rounded down, so +0 at first
level. If the PC has taken the Partial Warrior option
their class bonus increases this to +1 at first level.

Foci •19

Choosing a Focus
Every member of a class has certain baseline abilities
that let them do well at their role. Warriors are always
good combatants, Experts are always gifted with their
skills, and Psychics always have a few pertinent psionic
abilities. Aside from these baseline abilities, characters
also have a focus.
A focus is an additional knack, perk, or aptitude
that a hero has, one that grants them certain benefits
in play. Each focus has one or more levels of increasingly-strong effect. For example, someone with level
1 in the Die Hard focus gains two extra maximum hit
points each level and automatically stabilizes after a
mortal wound, while someone with level 2 can negate
the first injury they suffer each day that would incapacitate or kill them. The benefits of a focus stack, so
if you take level 2 in one, you get all the benefits from
level 1 as well.
Any character can pick any focus, and it doesn’t
have to “match” the class you selected. A Psychic can
choose the Unarmed Combatant focus for fistic prowess, while a Warrior might have enough experience
with battlefield trauma to qualify as a Healer. The only
obligation is that you explain how your hero picked
up the training or exhibited their natural aptitude for
the focus.
Many foci give a bonus level in a skill as part of
their level 1 benefits. These bonus levels work like any
other skill pick; they either give you the skill at level-0, raise an existing level-0 skill to level-1, or let you
pick any other non-psychic skill if the skill is already
at level-1.
Unless indicated otherwise a focus can be taken
only once. Once you’ve taken level 1 of Die Hard, you
can’t pick it again to get an additional two hit points per
level. Some skill-oriented foci allow you to pick them
more than once to apply to different skills.
Beginning PCs can pick one level of focus. PCs
with the Expert class or the Partial Expert Adventurer class option can choose an additional level in any
non-combat focus related to their background, including level 2 in their initial choice. Most will choose
Specialist, Healer, Diplomat, or some other similar focus,
but the GM can allow other non-combat foci. PCs with
the Warrior class or the Partial Warrior Adventurer
class option can do the same in choosing an additional
combat-related focus.
As your hero advances in experience, you’ll get the
opportunity to pick up new foci or improve existing
ones as you refine your talents or learn new tricks. In
some cases, you might work with the GM to come up
with a custom focus reflecting your PC’s specific special
talent or a perk that makes sense given their recent
adventures. Foci are an important part of a hero’s character, and they should always reflect something basic
about how they tend to interact with the world.

Origin Foci

If you include aliens or robots in your campaign, you
can represent them with origin foci. Origin foci are
taken the same way as any other foci, and may be purchased with a beginning character’s focus level.
If a GM is feeling generous, they can allow a PC
to take a level in an origin focus as well as their usual
free focus level, in order to allow a hero to start as an
alien with some additional knack. A PC who takes this
option doesn’t get their usual bonus focus at level 2;
they’ve already spent it on being unusual.
Origin foci for robotic VIs are on page 199. Available alien races will vary with the campaign setting, but
details on making these race are on page 209.

Choosing A Class and Focus
Basil Hayes needs a class. While an obvious pick
would be Expert to match his background, Simon
decides it would be more amusing to make him a
soldier; specifically, the sniper “Basilisk” Hayes, the
dire-eyed wraith of the cold Karelian forest. Given
the complete lack of a market for his PhD and his
own natural poor judgment, Basil signed up with
a Karelian mercenary outfit. He’s just gotten out
of his tour of duty, but at least now his skills are
significantly more marketable.
While Simon could go with the Adventurer
class for Basil and make him a Partial Warrior/
Partial Expert, he decides to make Basil a fullfledged Warrior. His intellectual talents can be
useful, but Basil’s main utility to the group is his
ability to deal with combat situations.
Every PC gets to pick one focus of any kind,
and a Warrior gets to pick one combat-related
focus. Basil’s first choice is easy, as clearly he’s a
Sniper, so he writes that down as a level 1 focus.
Rather than taking a second level in that with his
other pick, Simon decides to have Basil pick up
a level of the Gunslinger focus. Basil will get the
chance to pick more foci as he gains experience.
Each of these foci grant a bonus level in Shoot,
so they stack together to give the young sniper a
Shoot-1 skill. Basil’s now as deft with a rifle as he
is with 19th century Terran Victorian poetry.
Lastly, Basil gets to pick any single non-psychic skill of his choice as a hobby or natural talent.
He decides that a sniper isn’t much of a sniper
without being hard to spot, so picks Sneak-0 as his
skill. This free skill pick is often useful for filling in
the necessary talents of a concept that aren’t supplied by the Learning table or bonus skills granted
by a hero’s foci.

20• Foci

The Focus List
Alert

You are keenly aware of your surroundings and virtually impossible to take unaware. You have an instinctive
alacrity of response that helps you act before less wary
persons can think to move.
Level 1: Gain Notice as a bonus skill. You cannot be
surprised, nor can others use the Execution Attack
option on you. When you roll initiative, roll twice
and take the best result.
Level 2: You always act first in a combat round unless
someone else involved is also this Alert.

Armsman

You have an unusual competence with thrown weapons and melee attacks. This focus’ benefits do not apply
to unarmed attacks or projectile weapons. For thrown
weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the Armsman
focus at the same time as Gunslinger.
Level 1: Gain Stab as a bonus skill. You can draw or
sheath a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an
Instant action. You may add your Stab skill level to
a melee or thrown weapon’s damage roll or Shock
damage, assuming it has any to begin with.
Level 2: Your primitive melee and thrown weapons
count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a
melee weapon, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage
to the target, plus any Shock damage. This bonus
damage doesn’t apply to thrown weapons or attacks that use the Punch skill.

Assassin

You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain
advantages in carrying out an Execution Attack as described in the rules on page 52.
Level 1: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an
object no larger than a knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip search, including
normal TL4 weapon detection devices. You can
draw or produce this object as an On Turn action,
and your point-blank ranged attacks made from
surprise with it cannot miss the target.
Level 2: You can take a Move action on the same round
as you make an Execution Attack, closing rapidly
with a target before you attack. You may split this
Move action when making an Execution Attack,
taking part of it before you murder your target
and part of it afterwards. This movement happens
too quickly to alert a victim or to be hindered by
bodyguards, barring an actual physical wall of
meat between you and your prey.

Authority

You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one
that makes others instinctively follow your instructions
and further your causes. At level 1, this is a knack of
charm and personal magnetism, while level 2 might
suggest latent telepathic influence or transhuman memetic hacking augmentations. Where this focus refers
to followers, it means NPCs who have voluntarily chosen to be in your service. PCs never count as followers.
Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Once per day, you
can make a request from an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead skill check at
a difficulty of the NPC’s Morale score. If you succeed, they will comply with the request, provided
it is not harmful or extremely uncharacteristic.
Level 2: Those who follow you are fired with confidence. Any NPC being directly led by you gains a
Morale and hit roll bonus equal to your Lead skill
and a +1 bonus on all skill checks. Your followers
will not act against your interests unless under
extreme pressure.

Close Combatant

You’ve had all too much practice at close-in fighting
and desperate struggles with pistol or blade. You’re extremely skilled at avoiding injury in melee combat, and
at level 2 you can dodge through a melee scrum without
fear of being knifed in passing.
Level 1: Gain any combat skill as a bonus skill. You can
use pistol-sized ranged weapons in melee without suffering penalties for the proximity of melee
attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee
assailants, even if you’re unarmored at the time.
Level 2: The Shock damage from your melee attacks
treats all targets as if they were AC 10. The Fighting Withdrawal combat action is treated as an On
Turn action for you and can be performed freely.

Connected

You’re remarkably gifted at making friends and forging
ties with the people around you. Wherever you go, you
always seem to know somebody useful to your ends.
Level 1: Gain Connect as a bonus skill. If you’ve spent
at least a week in a not-entirely-hostile location,
you’ll have built a web of contacts willing to do
favors for you that are no more than mildly illegal.
You can call on one favor per game day and the
GM decides how far they’ll go for you.
Level 2: Once per game session, if it’s not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is
willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when and where you want to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are and what
they can do for you.

Foci •21

Die Hard

You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up under stresses that would incapacitate a
less determined hero.
Level 1: You gain an extra 2 maximum hit points per
level. This bonus applies retroactively if you take
this focus after first level. You automatically stabilize if mortally wounded by anything smaller than
a Heavy weapon.
Level 2: The first time each day that you are reduced to
zero hit points by an injury, you instead survive
with one hit point remaining. This ability can’t
save you from Heavy weapons or similar trauma.

Diplomat

You know how to get your way in personal negotiations, and can manipulate the attitudes of those around
you. Even so, while smooth words are versatile, they’ll
only work if your interlocutor is actually willing to
listen to you.
Level 1: Gain Talk as a bonus skill. You speak all the languages common to the sector and can learn new
ones to a workable level in a week, becoming fluent in a month. Reroll 1s on any skill check dice
related to negotiation or diplomacy.
Level 2: Once per game session, shift an intelligent
NPC’s reaction roll one step closer to friendly if
you can talk to them for at least thirty seconds.

Gunslinger

You have a gift with a gun. While this talent most commonly applies to slugthrowers or energy weapons, it
is also applicable to thrown weapons, bows, or other
ranged weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill.
For thrown weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the
Armsman focus at the same time as Gunslinger.
Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can draw or
holster a Stowed ranged weapon as an On Turn
action. You may add your Shoot skill level to a
ranged weapon’s damage roll.
Level 2: Once per round, you can reload a ranged weapon as an On Turn action if it takes no more than
one round to reload. Even on a miss with a Shoot
attack, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage.

Hacker

You have a considerable fluency with digital security
measures and standard encryption methods. You know
how to make computerized systems obey you until
their automatic failsafes come down on your control.
Level 1: Gain Program as a bonus skill. When attempting to hack a database or computerized system,
roll 3d6 on the skill check and drop the lowest die.
Level 2: Your hack duration increases to 1d4+Program
skill x 10 minutes. You have an instinctive understanding of the tech; you never need to learn the
data protocols for a strange system and are always
treated as familiar with it.

Healer

Healing comes naturally to you, and you’re particularly
gifted at preventing the quick bleed-out of wounded
allies and comrades.
Level 1: Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to
stabilize one mortally-wounded adjacent person
per round as an On Turn action. When rolling
Heal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
Level 2: Stims or other technological healing devices
applied by you heal twice as many hit points as
normal. Using only basic medical supplies, you
can heal 1d6+Heal skill hit points of damage to
every injured or wounded person in your group
with ten minutes of first aid spread among them.
Such healing can be applied to a given target only
once per day.

Henchkeeper

You have an distinct knack for picking up lost souls
who willingly do your bidding. You might induce them
with promises of money, power, excitement, sex, or
some other prize that you may or may not eventually
grant. A henchman obtained with this focus will serve
in loyal fashion until clearly betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not “important” people
in their society, and are usually marginal sorts, outcasts,
the desperate, or other persons with few options.
You can use more conventional pay or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, but these extra
hirelings are no more loyal or competent than your pay
and treatment can purchase.
Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire
henchmen within 24 hours of arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench material. These henchmen will not fight except to save
their own lives, but will escort you on adventures
and risk great danger to help you. Most henchmen will be treated as Peaceful Humans from the
Xenobestiary section of the book. You can have
one henchmen at a time for every three character levels you have, rounded up. You can release
henchmen with no hard feelings at any plausible
time and pick them back up later should you be
without a current henchman.
Level 2: Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and
determined, and will fight for you against anything but clearly overwhelming odds. Whether
through natural competence or their devotion
to you, they’re treated as Martial Humans from
the Xenobestiary section. You can make faithful
henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable NPCs,
but this requires that you actually have done them
some favor or help that would reasonably earn
such fierce loyalty.

22• Foci

Ironhide

Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck,
gengineered skin fibers, or subtle telekinetic shielding,
you have natural defenses equivalent to high-quality
combat armor. The benefits of this focus don’t stack
with armor, though Dexterity or shield modifiers apply.
Level 1: You have an innate Armor Class of 15 plus half
your character level, rounded up.
Level 2: Your abilities are so effective that they render
you immune to unarmed attacks or primitive
weaponry as if you wore powered armor.

Psychic Training

You’ve had special training in a particular psychic discipline. You must be a Psychic or have taken the Partial
Psychic class option as an Adventurer to pick this focus.
In the latter case, you can only take training in the discipline you initially chose as a Partial Psychic. As with
most foci, this focus can be taken only once.
Level 1: Gain any psychic skill as a bonus. If this improves it to level-1 proficiency, choose a free level-1 technique from that discipline. Your maximum Effort increases by one.
Level 2: When you advance a level, the bonus psychic
skill you chose for the first level of the focus automatically gets one skill point put toward increasing it or purchasing a technique from it. You may
save these points for later, if more are required to
raise the skill or buy a particular technique. These
points are awarded retroactively if you take this
focus level later in the game.

Savage Fray

You are a whirlwind of bloody havoc in melee combat,
and can survive being surrounded far better than most
combatants.
Level 1: Gain Stab as a bonus skill. All enemies adjacent
to you at the end of your turn whom you have not
attacked suffer the Shock damage of your weapon
if their Armor Class is not too high to be affected.
Level 2: After suffering your first melee hit in a round,
any further melee attacks from other assailants automatically miss you. If the attacker who hits you
has multiple attacks, they may attempt all of them,
but other foes around you simply miss.

Shocking Assault

You’re extremely dangerous to enemies around you.
The ferocity of your melee attacks stresses and distracts
enemies even when your blows don’t draw blood.
Level 1: Gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill. The Shock
damage of your weapon treats all targets as if they
were AC 10, assuming your weapon is capable of
harming the target in the first place.
Level 2: In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to the Shock
damage rating of all melee weapons and unarmed
attacks. Regular hits never do less damage than
this Shock would do on a miss.

Sniper

You are an expert at placing a bullet or beam on an
unsuspecting target. These special benefits only apply
when making an Execution Attack with a firearm or
bow, as described on page 52.
Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making
a skill check for an Execution Attack or target
shooting, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
Level 2: A target hit by your Execution Attack takes a
-4 penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid
immediate mortal injury. Even if the save is successful, the target takes double the normal damage
inflicted by the attack.

Specialist

You are remarkably talented at a particular skill. Whether a marvelous cat burglar, a world-famous athlete, a
brilliant engineer, or some other savant, your expertise
is extremely reliable. You may take this focus more than
once for different skills.
Level 1: Gain a non-combat, non-psychic skill as a bonus.
Roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die for all skill checks
in this skill.
Level 2: Roll 4d6 and drop the two lowest dice for all
skill checks in this skill.

Star Captain

You have a tremendous natural talent for ship combat,
and can make any starship you captain a significantly
more fearsome opponent. You must take the captain’s
role during a fight as described on page 117 of the Ship
Combat rules in order to benefit from this focus.
Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Your ship gains 2
extra Command Points at the start of each turn.
Level 2: A ship you captain gains bonus hit points equal
to 20% of its maximum at the start of each combat. Damage is taken from these bonus points first,
and they vanish at the end of the fight and do not
require repairs to replenish before the next. In addition, once per engagement, you may resolve a
Crisis as an Instant action by explaining how your
leadership resolves the problem.

Starfarer

You are an expert in the plotting and execution of interstellar spike drills. While most experienced pilots can
manage conventional drills along well-charted spike
routes, you have the knack for forging new drill paths
and cutting courses too dangerous for lesser navigators.
Level 1: Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. You automatically
succeed at all spike drill-related skill checks of difficulty 10 or less.
Level 2: Double your Pilot skill for all spike drill-related skill checks. Spike drives of ships you navigate
are treated as one level higher; thus, a drive-1 is
treated as a drive-2, up to a maximum of drive-7.
Spike drills you personally oversee take only half
the time they would otherwise require.

You have a natural knack for modifying and improving
equipment, as given in the rules on page 100.
Level 1: Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your Maintenance
score is doubled, allowing you to maintain twice
as many mods. Both ship and gear mods cost only
half their usual price in credits, though pretech
salvage requirements remain the same.
Level 2: Your Fix skill is treated as one level higher for
purposes of building and maintaining mods and
calculating your Maintenance score. Advanced
mods require one fewer pretech salvage part to
make, down to a minimum of zero.

Unarmed Combatant

Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives
and guns in the grip of the less gifted. Your unarmed
attacks are counted as melee weapons when it comes to
binding up opponents wielding rifles and similar long
arms, though you need at least one hand free to do so.
Level 1: Gain Punch as a bonus skill. Your unarmed
attacks become more dangerous as your Punch
skill increases. At level-0, they do 1d6 damage. At
level-1, they do 1d8 damage. At level-2 they do
1d10, level-3 does 1d12, and level-4 does 1d12+1.
At Punch-1 or better, they have the Shock quality
equal to your Punch skill against AC 15 or less.
While you normally add your Punch skill level to
any unarmed damage, don’t add it twice to this
Shock damage.
Level 2: You know locks and twists that use powered
servos against their wearer. Your unarmed attacks
count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a
Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage.

Unique Gift

Whether due to exotic technological augmentation, a
unique transhuman background, or a remarkable human talent, you have the ability to do something that’s
simply impossible for a normal human.
This is a special focus which serves as a catch-all
for some novel power or background perk that doesn’t
have a convenient fit in the existing rules. A transhuman who can function normally in lethal environments,
a nanotech-laden experimental subject with a head full
of exotic sensors, or a brilliant gravitic scientist who
can fly thanks to their personal tech might all take this
focus to cover their special abilities.
It’s up to the GM to decide what’s reasonable and
fair to be covered under this gift. If an ability is particularly powerful, it might require the user to take System
Strain to use it, as described on page 32.
As a general rule this ability should be better than
a piece of gear the PC could buy for credits. The player
is spending a very limited resource when they make
this focus pick, so what they get should be good enough
that they can’t just duplicate it with a fat bank account.

Wanderer

Your hero gets around. As part of a life on the road,
they’ve mastered a number of tricks for ensuring their
mobility and surviving the inevitable difficulties of a
vagabond existence.
Level 1: Gain Survive as a bonus skill. You can convey
basic ideas in all the common languages of the
sector. You can always find free transport to a desired destination for yourself and a small group of
your friends provided any traffic goes to the place.
Finding this transport takes no more than an hour,
but it may not be a strictly legitimate means of
travel and may require working passage.
Level 2: You can forge, scrounge, or snag travel papers
and identification for the party with 1d6 hours
of work. These papers and permits will stand up
to ordinary scrutiny, but require an opposed Int/
Administer versus Wis/Notice check if examined
by an official while the PC is actually wanted by
the state for some crime. When finding transport
for the party, the transportation always makes the
trip at least as fast as a dedicated charter would.

Wild Psychic Talent

Some men and women are born with a very limited
form of MES, the mental condition that allows for the
use of psychic powers. While these people are not true
psychics, these “wild talents” can create one limited psychic effect. Training is not always required to develop
this ability, and their MES is so mild that they don’t
suffer the risk of madness or brain damage that more
developed psychics risk should they use their powers
without proper training.
Wild talents are not treated as psychics for general purposes and cannot “torch” their powers. When
relevant, they are treated as having one point of Effort.
Psychics and Partial Psychics cannot take this focus.
Level 1: Pick a psychic discipline. You gain an ability
equivalent to the level-0 core power of that discipline. Optionally, you may instead pick a level-1
technique from that discipline, but that technique must stand alone; you can’t pick one that
augments another technique or core ability. For
example, you could pick the Telekinetic Armory
technique from Telekinesis, because that ability
does not require the use of any other Telekinesis power. You could not pick the Mastered Succor
ability from Biopsionics, because that technique is
meant to augment another power you don’t have.
Level 2: You now have a maximum Effort of two points.
You may pick a second ability according to the
guidelines above. This second does not need to be
a stand-alone technique if it augments the power
you chose for level 1 of this focus. Thus, if your
first pick was gaining the level-0 power of Psychic
Succor, your second could be Mastered Succor. You
still could not get the level-1 core power of Psychic
Succor, however, as you’re still restricted to level-0.

24• Final Touches

Final Touches
You’re almost finished. Just a few more things to note
down, and you’ll have an adventurer ready for play.
First, pick one more non-psychic skill of your
choice. This pick represents your hobbies, your side
interests, or some well of natural talent. You gain it at
level-0 if you don’t already have it. Otherwise, it stacks
to increase the skill to level-1. You can’t pick a skill you
already have at level-1.
Next, determine your maximum hit points. Your
hit points are a measure of how close you are to death
or defeat; when you run out of them, your character is
dead or unable to continue fighting. You can regain lost
hit points by rest and biopsionic healing, but they cannot exceed their maximum. Your maximum hit points
are equal to 1d6 plus your Constitution modifier, down
to a minimum of 1 hit point. Warriors and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option can add a +2
bonus to this total.
Now note down your base attack bonus. For most
PCs, this is equal to half your character level, rounded
down, so it’s +0 for most characters. If your hero is a
Warrior or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior
class option, your beginning base attack bonus is +1.
Record your Physical, Mental, and Evasion saving
throws. Your Physical saving throw is 15 minus the
better of your Strength or Constitution attribute modifiers. Your Mental saving throw is 15 minus the better
of your Wisdom or Charisma attribute modifiers. Your
Evasion saving throw is 15 minus the better of your
Dexterity or Intelligence attribute modifiers. If you
have a penalty in both modifiers, it’s possible to have a
saving throw of 16 or more.
Lastly, either choose an equipment package from
the list on the opposite page or roll 2d6 x 100 to find out
how many credits you have to buy your beginning gear.

PCs and Languages
The standard language of the late Terran Mandate
was a highly hybridized version of English. All PCs
are assumed to speak “Mandate” unless they’ve got
a very good reason not to, and will rapidly pick up
enough to get by otherwise.
PCs also speak all the languages appropriate to their background and history. A native
of a French-speaking world will naturally speak
French, or whatever French is in 3200 AD.
Linguist PCs with the Know skill know additional languages; one more at level-0, three more
at level-1, six more at level-2, ten more at level-3,
and all sector-known languages at level-4. PCs
who are far-traveled or versed in dealing with
other cultures may substitute Connect instead of
Know to determine their bonus languages.

Final Touches •25

Equipment Packages
Rather than choosing gear from the Equipment chapter, you can just take a premade package from this page
instead of taking your starting credits.
Once you’ve chosen your equipment, make sure to
note down the damage and hit bonus of your weapons,
and the Armor Class of any armor you have.
For weapons, your hit bonus is your base attack
bonus plus your applicable skill, plus the attribute modifier used by the weapon. For ranged weapons, this
is usually Dexterity, while most melee weapons are
Strength or Dexterity. Ranged energy weapons add +1
to this, as they lack recoil or windage. Damage is equal
to the weapon’s damage die plus the attribute modifier.
For armor, your total Armor Class is that of your
armor plus your Dexterity modifier. Multiple suits of
armor do not stack together.

If you don’t have the time or inclination to do things
the leisurely way, you can use these pages to quickly
roll up a hero. You can either pick or roll from any of
the tables to get a character that suits.

The first step is to roll on the class table below. This will
give you your class, your attributes, the hit point die to
roll, and your attack bonus. Each class “style” hints at
the kind of PC those attributes might describe.

Next, it’s time to pick or roll from the background table
to the right. Don’t worry if it doesn’t seem to fit your
class; if your Melee Warrior happens to roll a past as
a Scholar, just take a moment to decide why it is that
an erudite scientist might also have a savage left hook.
You can switch around your attributes if you want to
make things fit more closely, such as swapping your
Intelligence and Charisma in the case above.
The background options are general concepts as
described starting on page 10. Your hero might be
a model example of their type, or you might shuffle
around their details a little, deciding your Ranged Warrior Official is an ex-cop bounced out of the force after
investigating an alien smuggling ring a little too closely.
Once you’ve rolled or chosen your background,
note down the three skills listed with it. If one of the
skills says “Any Combat”, choose either Punch, Shoot,
or Stab depending on what fits best for your hero.
You’ll want to decide on your homeworld at this
point too. If you’re not familiar with the campaign
setting, describe your hero’s background and ask the
GM which planet they’re most likely from. The GM
can then fill you in on any important cultural or social
details that might’ve influenced your hero’s history.

Background

If you picked or rolled the Psychic class, roll twice on
the table to the left to find out what psychic disciplines
you’ve trained to level-0. If you roll or pick the same
one twice, it’s level-1, and you should pick a free level-1
technique from the Psionics chapter on page 28.
Take a minute to decide where you were trained
to safely use your innate powers. If you’re not sure, ask
the GM which psychic academy makes the most sense.

Now roll 1d6 or pick from the table below to get appropriate foci for your hero, assuming you’d rather not
pick freely. All the foci listed below are gained at level 1
proficiency and are described starting on page 20. Psychics can pick one focus. The other classes get one free
pick, plus one more combat focus for Warriors and one
more non-combat focus for Experts.
When you choose a focus, you might get a bonus
skill from it. If you don’t have that skill, you gain it at

level-0. If you have it at level-0, it becomes level-1. And
if you already have it at level-1, pick any other non-psychic skill instead that isn’t already level-1.
The focus you pick or roll tells you a lot about your
hero’s past. A smooth Expert who’s a Connected Diplomat might have been an underworld fixer, while a
Healer with Specialization in Talk could have been a
psychiatrist or therapist. Take a moment to figure out
how your hero’s foci reflect their past experience.

Now it’s time for a few final touches.
Pick or roll a bonus skill. You can use the table to
the right or just choose any non-psychic skill to add at
level-0 to your hero. You can pick a skill you already
have at level-0 to make it level-1 instead.
If you’re playing a Psychic, note down your beginning maximum Effort, which is equal to 1 plus your
highest psychic skill plus the better of your Wisdom
or Constitution modifiers.
Write down your saving throws. Your Physical saving throw is equal to 15 minus your Strength
or Constitution modifiers, whichever is better. Your
Evasion saving throw is equal to 15 minus the better
of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers, and your
Mental saving throw is 15 minus the better of your
Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.
Pick your starting equipment, either rolling 2d6
x 100 to find your beginning credit total or picking a
package from page 25. Note down your beginning hit
bonus totals and damage for any weapons you have,
and the Armor Class total for any armor you wear.
Finally, put a name on this budding hero and
choose their initial goal. What are they trying to accomplish right now? Get rich? Get off their tedious
homeworld? Take revenge on a local tyrant? Whatever
you pick should be something that motivates your hero
from the very start, and it should also be something that
complements the interests of the rest of the players.
Nobody’s going to thank you if you roll up a PC that
none of the other party members would want to associate with, or one that can’t be expected to play nicely
with the rest of the group.

PSIONICS
Psionic powers first manifested centuries ago in the
wake of the first interstellar flights. Later paraphysicists speculated that something about the exposure to
metadimensional energies incurred in spike drive travel changed these spacers, altering genomes or warping
their energy shadows in a way that changed their eventual offspring. While this theory was never completely
proven, it was demonstrated that psionic powers were
far more prevalent on the frontier, in people who were
descended of starfaring ancestors, than they were on
Old Terra. On most frontier worlds about one in ten
thousand children are born with psychic aptitude,
while Old Terra displayed only a tenth of that incidence.
Psychic abilities initially seemed to be a congenital
curse, one known as “Metadimensional Extroversion
Syndrome”, or MES. Children manifested MES in puberty or early adulthood, after certain critical stages of
brain development opened a channel between their
minds and the churning maelstrom of energies that
boiled in metadimensional space. By a conscious or unconscious act of will, they could release these energies
in various forms. Even so, the passage of unmediated
metadimensional force through unprotected neural tissue almost invariably caused brain damage. Repeated
use of these abilities caused crippling disability, death,
or madness. Most psychics were dead within a few
years after manifesting. A few were able to control their
powers sufficiently to prevent accidental discharges,
but safe, controlled use of these abilities was unknown.
In response, the Terran Mandate initiated the
Psionic Authority, basing it on a terraformed Mars.
Children from throughout Mandate space were carefully selected by the Authority and brought to the institute in order to study and hopefully cure this tragic
condition. Persistent legends speak of horrible experiments and ruthless sacrifices of “test subjects”, but no
proof of such evil ever emerged, and after decades of
study, the Psionic Authority was actually able to produce protocols that allowed controlled, safe employment of psionic powers.
The bloom of psitech development that followed
and the wonders of jump gates and the Second Wave
of human expansion are a matter of history. So too is
the Scream that erupted six centuries ago and granted
every living psychic in human space either violent madness or instant death. The interstellar societal collapse
that followed and the centuries-long Silence between
the stars has been a matter of living memory for many
ill-connected frontier worlds.
With the Scream and the death or madness of every potential psychic tutor, psionics became the horror it once was generations ago. Untrained psychics
suffer under the lash of their own abilities, doomed to
early death if they aren’t fortunate enough to fumble
into a means of damping their own powers. Men and

women of some worlds now fear psychics, not only for
the ancestral memory of the Scream and the chaos that
followed, but also because their only experience with
these unfortunates has been one of uncontrolled power,
madness, and death.
In the past few centuries, however, a few worlds
have managed to resuscitate the ancient psychic protocols and develop metapsionic tutors skilled enough to
train new psychics. For some, it was the fruit of some
discovered pretech wonder that damped psychic energies enough to safely experiment. For others, it was the
product of coldly ruthless experimentation on disposable psychic test victims. A few worlds even retained
some shreds of psychic mastery from the ancient days,
the result of a Scream victim who was lucid enough
to teach pupils, though usually for some demented or
horrible end. Whatever the source, these institutions
provide desperately-desired training for those few afflicted with MES.
These “psychic academies” are scattered widely
throughout the sectors of space, usually based out of
some amenable planetary polity or defensible deepspace habitat. Some academies are exclusively for the
use of a particular nation or planet, while others will
accept anyone who can pay the tuition or satisfy the
interests of their patrons. Most are powerful players in
the local political scene, offering services that mean life
and death to MES sufferers and producing graduates
who are extremely useful to local rulers. Others need
to operate in secret, avoiding the fearful attention of
populations that neither accept nor trust their powers.

Psychic Characters and Training

All Psychic PCs are assumed to have had some sort of
training. They may have received their education at a
world-famous psychic academy on their homeworld, or
been taught in secret by a peripatetic psychic mentor,
but only one in a million psychics has the blind luck and
natural aptitude to develop an intuitive control of their
MES. Of course, it may be that your PC was that one
in a million, but you’ll want to discuss it with your GM.
Psychic training requires from one to four years
to complete, depending on the aptitude of the pupil
and the amount of training support they get from other psychics. Most academies have one or more “deans”
who actually have the metapsionic abilities to dampen
and buffer novice minds. Regular application of their
abilities to the pupils allows the students to safely practice and train with their powers until they’ve mastered
the channeling of the energies. Aside from these deans,
additional psychic tutors can speed the learning process
by demonstrations, technical critique, and “encouragement” of various kinds.
On worlds where psionics are outlawed or feared,
most MES sufferers learn to either conceal their pow-

30• Psionics
ers or accept swift euthanasia or exile from a society
that dreads their abilities. Most are unable to do this;
their innate abilities boil out at some inopportune time,
and their true nature is revealed to their grieving family
and neighbors. Those who do learn to contain their
abilities can go their whole lives unsuspected. A few
receive secret teachings from wandering adepts, ones
who can quickly show them how to suppress their
powers. The best and most promising might be taken
as full students by these adepts, shown how to master
their own abilities and eventually teach others as well.
On planets where psionic powers are less terrifying there is always at least one psychic academy in the
solar system that invites pupils. Some charge exorbitant
tuition, but most are supported by governments, private organizations, or successful graduates. Students
are expected to pay for their training one way or another, however; if not in credits, then in service to the
patron on completion of the training. Many psychics
with decidedly non-academic Backgrounds acquired
their experience in the mandatory service period after their graduation. Most psychic PCs will have left
such duties behind by the time they start adventuring,
though a few of them may have departed considerably
in advance of their expected release date.

Psionic Skills

Psionic powers are divided up into disciplines, each of
which has a corresponding skill. Someone with a basic,
functioning expertise in the skill has level-0, while a
true master of the art would have level-4. Only psychics
can learn psionic skills, and they are most often taught
at rigidly-disciplined psychic academies. Attempting to
develop these skills without such formalized training
is almost invariably lethal to the experimenter, though
an exceedingly few natural prodigies sometimes intuitively grasp their principles. Even fewer of these gifted
naturals are able to express their understanding in a
coherent, teachable form.
Some psychics are “unrestricted”. While they usually have a distinct aptitude for one or two disciplines,
they can theoretically learn any of them, and may raise
any psionic skill they choose. Any character with the
Psychic class is an unrestricted psychic. Others demonstrate gifts in only one discipline. While they can eventually master all aspects of that power, they can’t raise
any other psychic skill. Adventurers with the Partial
Psychic class option are such “restricted” psychics.
Attempting to wield a natural psionic aptitude
without proper precautions will almost inevitably
cause death or madness, as the uncontrolled cascade of
MES energies will cause varying forms of permanent
brain damage. Untrained psychics can sometimes get
away with using their powers very rarely, but these natural prodigies rarely have any ability beyond level-1 in a
discipline. Those who use their powers often enough to
gain more practical field experience can expect to end
up dead, crippled, or insane.

Psionic Powers and Techniques

Every psychic who obtains level-0 proficiency in a discipline gains access to its core technique. This technique
varies depending on the discipline, whether it’s physical
translocation with Teleportation or tissue repair with
Biopsionics. The strength of the ability varies with the
practitioner’s skill level; the Psychic Succor provided by
a biopsionicist with level-0 proficiency is much weaker
than that provided by someone with level-4 expertise.
Core techniques improve naturally as the psychic improves their skill level. They do not need to be purchased with skill points or otherwise specially trained.
As a psychic improves their skill level in a discipline, they may also learn other techniques, special
tricks and abilities they’ve refined through practice.
Each time they improve a skill level, they can pick a
new technique from that discipline. Most techniques
have a minimum skill level associated with them, and
the PC can’t pick a technique which requires a higher skill level than they’ve mastered. They also cannot
“save” technique picks for later, either. They must be
chosen immediately after improving the skill.
The techniques listed under the disciplines here
are commonly-known arts that are part of the basic
curriculum of most competent psychic academies. No
special training is required to choose them when a PC
is able to pick a new technique, as the principles were
taught as part of their basic education. Other techniques exist that are more esoteric in nature, and may
require a trainer to educate the PC in their principles
before they can be learned.
Even so, some of the standard techniques might
be selectively restricted by an academy, taught only to
certain pupils. In some cases, this may be due to a sponsor’s restrictions on what kind of abilities they want the
local psychics to possess, while other academies might
consider them fundamentally immoral abilities. Control over the metapsionic technique of psychic tutoring
is particularly strict, as any pupil who has its rudiments
included in their curriculum may eventually be able
to train other psychics in turn. A PC may have to go
to significant lengths in order to patch the holes in a
government-controlled psychic curriculum.
PCs who want to learn additional techniques beyond those acquired by improving their skills may buy
them separately with skill points, paying one point per
level of the technique. PCs who want to retrain techniques may do so at the GM’s discretion, usually only
when they encounter some new esoteric technique
they’d like to learn in place of an existing art. Techniques can only be retrained into others of equal or
lower required skill level.
It may be possible for a psychic to create entirely
new techniques to reflect their personal aptitudes and
special inclinations. Any such novelty is strictly at the
GM’s discretion, and unlikely to be done more than
once or twice over the lifetime of even the most skilled
psychic experimenter.

Psionics •31

Effort and Psychic Abilities

Psionic powers are fueled by Effort, a measure of the
psychic’s mental focus, energy, and neural responsiveness. A psychic’s maximum Effort total is equal to one
plus the higher of their Wisdom or Constitution attribute modifiers, plus their highest psychic skill score.
Thus, a psychic with a Wisdom modifier of -1, a Constitution modifier of +2, and psionic skills of Metapsionics-0 and Biopsionics-0 would have a maximum
Effort score of 3. If he were to then improve his Biopsionics skill to level-1, his Effort would become 4.
Effort is “Committed” to fuel a psionic power.
Some Commitment is relatively short-term, lasting
only as long as the power is in effect. Other powers
require that the Effort be Committed for the full scene,
while the most powerful might require it be Committed for the rest of the day. Once the Commitment period is over, the Effort returns to the psychic. All Effort
is refreshed after a good night’s rest.
Whenever a power requires you to Commit Effort,
you commit only one point, though additional effects
or triggerings may require separate Commitments.

Torching

Psychics can push past their limits by “torching”, intentionally ignoring safety protocols and neural refractory
periods to channel MES energy beyond their normal
capacity. For untrained MES subjects, all their power
use qualifies as torching, as they lack the training necessary to develop safe reserves of Effort.
Torching is an Instant action that can be performed once per round. It provides a free point of Effort that lasts for the rest of the scene, even if this point
puts a psychic over the maximum allowed. Every time
the psychic torches, however, they have to roll on the
torching result table below.
d6

Torching Result

1-2

Lose 1 point from your Wisdom score

3-4

Lose 1 point from your Constitution score

5

Lose 1 point from an attribute you choose

6

No harm is done by the torching

Psychics reduced below a Wisdom score of 3 go
violently insane and become “feral psychics”; those reduced below scores of 3 in other attributes likewise
become dead or nonviable as player characters. There is
no available cure for brain damage caused by torching,
and even advanced pretech technology has no generally-known remedy.
Feral psychics are exceptionally dangerous, as their
form of brain damage invariably results in violent, psychotic behavior and terrifying hallucinations. Worse
still, they can torch with impunity thereafter, as the
MES energies have already burnt a clear path through
what remains of their sanity. Feral psychics have effectively unlimited Effort with what powers they have
obtained. There is no known cure for a feral psychic.

Attitudes Toward Psychics

Most worlds have a warily accepting attitude toward
psionic abilities. Provided they’ve received appropriate
training, a psychic can live and work in relative peace.
They are not normally required to wear any sort of
external badge or marking, and they are entitled to
keep their own abilities private from anyone but the
government if they so wish. They may be subject to
mandatory “national service”, depending on the polity, and their special abilities might be impressed by
the government in cases of extreme need, but they are
able to live a relatively normal, if very well-remunerated life. Ordinary men and women have only a vague
understanding of psychic powers, but they understand
enough to know the basic types of disciplines and the
sort of effects each can produce.
Other worlds have a warmer attitude towards psychics. Those gifted with MES are elevated above the
ordinary rabble, their abilities celebrated and directed
toward the advantage of their communities. Such societies often have psychic ability as a prerequisite for
substantial authority, and have worked precognitive
visions or telepathic scans into the ordinary fabric of
life. Offworld psychics tend to be treated with considerable respect on these worlds, though sometimes they’re
also expected to provide services or guidance they may
not be equipped to give. Citizens of these worlds usually have an excellent understanding of how psychic
disciplines work, in addition to understanding ways
to counter them.
A few worlds have outright hostility towards psychics and their abilities. MES sufferers might be viewed
as pitiable victims of a lethal affliction they can’t control, but trained and capable psychics are threats to be
wiped out. Their telepathic probings, cheating foresight, and impossibly elusive teleportation makes them
a menace to normal human beings, and society cannot
tolerate their existence. Some worlds forbid psionics
out of fear of another Scream, while others do so out
of misunderstandings, a desire for social stability, or local conditions that make psionic powers exceptionally
dangerous. A few of these worlds have private psychic
academies to train psionic myrmidons for the ruling
class or deniable agents of private intrigue.
On almost all worlds, however, psychics can expect to suffer considerably harsher legal penalties than
conventional criminals. Some worlds simply have no
resources to jail an unwilling teleporter or mind-reading telepath, while others expect those of great gifts to
have correspondingly great virtue. It’s not unknown
for psychics to face summary execution for crimes that
would earn other malefactors a simple jail sentence.
A few worlds have ancient pretech artifacts or
technologies that are capable of defeating or suppressing psychic powers. Such resources are always extremely rare, and normally only deployed to protect heads of
state and similar top-level figures, along with government sites of planetary importance.

32• Biopsionics

Biopsionics
Biopsionic powers repair, augment, debilitate, or damage living creatures. Unless otherwise specified the
biopsionicist must be able to touch a target, though
clothing and armor do not interfere with the use of
these abilities. Touching a willing or unsuspecting target is automatic, whereas touching a resisting target
requires a normal Punch hit roll with a bonus equal to
the practitioner’s Biopsionics skill. Such touch effects
do not inflict the normal damage of a Punch attack.
Unsurprisingly, biopsionic powers are among the
most accepted psychic abilities. Even a modestly-experienced biopsion can perform miracles of healing for a
community lucky enough to have their services.

System Strain

Many curative biopsionic powers add to the target’s
System Strain. System Strain is a measure of the amount
of system stress, intrusive modification, and general biological distress an organism might be suffering. Psionic healing, cybernetic implants, and powerful drugs all
add to a target’s System Strain.
If using a power or drug on a target would make
their System Strain exceed their Constitution score, the
effect fails to function; their body simply cannot adapt
to the changes and cannot benefit from them.
System Strain decreases automatically by one point
after each night of rest, provided the organism is wellfed and not compromised by sickness or privation.

Core Technique- Psychic Succor

The adept’s touch stabilizes critically-wounded organisms. More sophisticated practitioners can heal tissue
injuries, though curing diseases, detoxifying poisons,
and fixing congenital deformities require additional
techniques. Each use of Psychic Succor adds one point
of System Strain to the target, or two points if they
were mortally wounded at the time.
Activating Psychic Succor requires the biopsion to
Commit Effort for the day. Once used, they can continue to use it for the rest of that scene without Committing Effort again.
Level-0: The psychic’s touch can automatically stabilize
a mortally-wounded target as a Main Action. This
power must be used on a target within six rounds
of their collapse, and does not function on targets that have been decapitated or killed by Heavy
weapons. It’s the GM’s decision as to whether a
target is intact enough for this power to work.
Level-1: As level-0, and heal 1d6+1 hit points of damage.
If used on a mortally-wounded target, they revive
with the rolled hit points and can act normally on
the next round.
Level-2: As level-1, but healing 2d6+2 hit points instead.
Level-3: As level-2, but healing 2d6+6 hit points instead.
Level-4: As level-3, but healing 3d6+8 hit points instead.

Mastered Succor

Level-1

The biopsion has developed a sophisticated mastery of
their core ability, and they no longer need to Commit
Effort to activate it, and may use it whenever they wish.
The use of additional techniques that augment Psychic
Succor might still require Effort to be Committed.
Organic Purification Protocols
Level-1
The biopsion’s Psychic Succor now cures any poisons or
diseases the subject may be suffering, albeit it requires
Committing Effort for the day as an additional surcharge. Biowarfare organisms, exceptionally virulent
diseases, or TL5 toxins may resist this curing, requiring
a Wis/Biopsionics skill check at a difficulty of at least
10. Failure means that the adept cannot cure the target’s
disease. This technique cannot cure congenital illnesses.
Remote Repair
Level-1
Psychic Succor and other biopsionic techniques that normally require touch contact can now be applied at a
distance up to 100 meters, provided the biopsion can
see the target with their unaided vision. Hostile powers
that normally require a hit roll will hit automatically.
Each time this technique is used, Effort must be Committed for the scene.
Invincible Stand
Level-2
The biopsion has mastered techniques of emergency
tissue reinforcement and system stabilization. As an
Instant action, they can Commit Effort for the scene to
keep themself or a target they can touch active even at
zero hit points. This technique must be used once every
round on the target or they collapse at the end of the
round. If the target suffers hit point damage, the biopsion must Instantly Commit Effort for the scene or the
target goes down immediately with a mortal wound. A
Heavy weapon hit on a subject of this power or similar
physical dismemberment will always kill a target, regardless of this technique.
Major Organ Restoration
Level-2
The biopsion’s Psychic Succor can now cure congenital birth defects and regrow missing limbs and organs.
It can even be used to stabilize targets that have been
dropped by Heavy weapons, decapitated, or otherwise
dramatically dismembered, provided it’s used within
one round per level of Biopsionic skill. The best that
can be done for such badly-mangled targets is stabilization, after which they must rest for 24 hours before any
further hit points can be healed by Biopsionics, stims,
or natural rest.

Biopsionics •33
Tissue Integrity Field

Level-2

The biopsion’s Psychic Succor may now also affect all
allies within ten meters of the target. Allies can decline
the healing if they don’t require it or don’t want to take
the additional System Strain. Each use of this technique
requires that the biopsion Commit Effort for the day in
addition to the cost of the Psychic Succor.
Accelerated Succor
Level-3
The biopsion’s Psychic Succor now can be used as an On
Turn power, albeit only once per round. By Committing an additional Effort for the day with each use, it
can even be used as an Instant power, though it still
can only be used once per round. Any surcharges for
augmenting the succor apply normally, such as with
Tissue Integrity Field.
Metamorph
Level-3
The biopsion can now shape their own or another willing target’s physical form as a Main Action, transforming a touched target into any humanoid form within
50% of their own mass. Claws and other body armaments can be fashioned equivalent to Light or Medium
melee weapons and innate armor equivalent to AC 13.
Gills and other environmental-survival alterations are
also viable at the GM’s discretion, but flight is a bridge
too far for this power.
A person can be impersonated down to the DNA
level, provided a blood or hair sample is available. The
use of this adds one System Strain point to the target
that does not recover so long as the change is in effect.
Applying Metamorph requires that the biopsion Commit
Effort for as long as the change is to be maintained. If
applied to a target other than the psychic, the power
automatically ends if the psychic gets more than one
hundred kilometers away.
Teratic Overload
Level-3
This use of biopsionics inflicts potentially-lethal damage on a touched target as a Main Action, and requires
that the biopsion Commit Effort for the scene. The
target suffers 1d6 damage per level of the psychic’s Biopsionics skill and must make a Physical saving throw.
On a failure, the damage is tripled and the target is now
affected by an obvious, lethal cancer that will kill them
in 1d6 months. The cancer can be treated by a TL4
hospital or ship’s sick bay if managed within a month’s
time. If the biopsion Commits Effort for the day instead
of the scene, they can control the power sufficiently to
do no hit point damage and create very subtle tumors,
leaving the cancer undetectable without a TL4 medical
examination. Such victims probably won’t even know
they’ve been attacked by this power. Whether a success
or failure, this power cannot be used on the same target
more than once per scene.

Holistic Optimization Patterning

Level-4

The biopsion gains the ability to drastically augment
their own or a touched ally’s physical abilities as an
On Turn action. This boost lasts for the rest of the
scene, adds two points of System Strain to the target
and gives them a +2 bonus to all Strength or Dexterity
skill checks, hit rolls, and damage rolls along with 20
extra hit points. Any damage is taken off these temporary hit points first, and both the bonuses and any
hit points in excess of the target’s maximum are lost at
the end of the scene. Each invocation of this technique
requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for the day, and
this power cannot be used on a given target more than
once per scene.
Quintessential Reconstruction
Level-4
The biopsion becomes extremely difficult to kill, encoding their mind in a coherent pattern of MES energy
coterminous with their realspace coordinates. If killed,
the psychic will regenerate from the largest remaining fragment of their body over 24 hours. This process maximizes their System Strain for one week. If
brought to zero hit points during this week, they die
instantly and permanently. The psychic retains a vague
awareness of their surroundings while “dead” and can
postpone their regeneration for up to a week in order
to avoid notice, but burial or entombment may result in
a very short second life. Each use of this power inflicts
one point of permanent attribute loss in an attribute
of the biopsion’s choice.

Biopsionics and Hospitals
Biopsionics is a spectacularly effective discipline
for curing physical injuries and sicknesses, but
its use for the latter is capped by the biopsion’s
available Effort. Hospitals on worlds with access to
psychic academies often have several biopsions on
staff, proficient with the requisite techniques and
capable of quickly healing tremendous amounts of
trauma injuries on short notice.
Assuming one proficient and available biopsion for every 100,000 citizens, however, the total
amount of sickness-curing ability is going to be
very limited, and likely reserved for the powerful
and wealthy. The vanishingly few psychics who
are master metapsions capable of the Flawless
Mastery of Organic Purification Protocols can easily
command as much as two thousand credits a day
just for temporary work at a grateful hospital.
Ordinary PC biopsions who want to pick up
some extra work curing sicknesses can usually find
temp employment with a local medical facility for
50 credits per day per Effort point they have. Note
that some patients may be very upset if the hospital
fails to assign them the PC’s limited Effort.

34• Metapsionics

Metapsionics
Metapsionics is the rarest and most esoteric of the psychic disciplines, with few psychics having the necessary
temperament or interest in developing these complex
abilities. A metapsion controls psychic energy itself,
molding and shaping the flows of energy that spill
through the brains of those marked by MES.
Taken in isolation, metapsionics allows a psychic
to increase the raw Effort available to them and become
more flexible in how this Effort is used. Expert metapsions can even teach other potential psychics how to
control and channel their new abilities, and the services
of a trained psychic mentor command considerable
sums in most systems.
Beyond this, in most stellar sectors a competent
metapsion is the only practical way to protect a target
from undetectable psychic assault. Without a vigilant
brainguard, a head of state, interstellar celebrity, or
planetary oligarch might find their minds rifled effortlessly by some undetected psychic intruder.
As a consequence, many metapsions become much
more physically competent and better-trained in combat than the average psychic. The high prices they can
command as brainguards attract some, though others
find their clients too aggravating to endure for long.

Core Technique- Psychic Refinement

The metapsion gains improved mastery over their own
powers and an innate sensitivity to the use of psionic
abilities in their presence.
Level-0: The adept can visually and audibly detect the
use of psychic powers. If both the source and target are visible to the metapsion, they can tell who’s
using the power, even if it’s normally imperceptible. They gain a +2 bonus on any saving throw
versus a psionic power.
Level-1: The metapsion’s maximum Effort increases by
an additional point.
Level-2: The adept can determine whether or not a
person is a psychic or has latent psionic abilities
through one round of visual inspection. Their saving throw bonus against psionic powers increases
to +3.
Level-3: The metapsion’s maximum Effort increases by
an additional point.
Level-4: The metapsion can perform a slightly safer
version of torching. Instead of rolling the torching damage die, they simply suffer 10 hit points of
damage after torching is used. The damage occurs
after the fueled power activates, allowing a psychic
at low hit points to trigger a power before falling
unconscious. This damage cannot be healed by
anything but natural bed rest, though a psychic
can be stabilized if this technique drops her to zero
hit points.

Cloak Powers
Level-1
The metapsion can conceal their own psychic abilities
from metapsionic senses. They must Commit Effort
for as long as they wish to cloak their powers. While
hidden, only a metapsion with equal or higher skill in
Metapsionics can detect their abilities with their level-0
or level-2 Psychic Refinement abilities. In such cases, an
opposed Wis/Metapsionics roll is made between the
metapsion and the investigator. If the investigator wins,
the cloak is pierced, while if the metapsion wins, the
investigator’s Psychic Refinement remains oblivious.
Mindtracing
Level-1
The metapsion can trace back the use of psionic powers
they’ve noticed in their presence. By Committing Effort for the scene as an Instant action, they can see and
hear through the senses of a user of a psychic power,
gaining an intuitive awareness of their location and
treating them as a visible target for purposes of their
own abilities. Thus, if they see someone being affected
by a telepathy power with no visible source, they can
use this ability to briefly share the hidden telepath’s
senses. If used on a target that is teleporting, they can
perceive the teleporter’s view of their destination. Use
on a metamorphically-shaped impostor would reveal
the biopsion responsible for the change, and so forth.
These shared senses last for only one round and do not
interfere with the adept’s other actions.
Synthetic Adaptation
Level-1
This is a particularly esoteric technique, one that requires the adept to have at least Program-0 or Fix-0
skill in order to master. With it, however, the metapsion has learned how to synergize with the quantum
intelligence of a VI or True AI in order to apply Telepathy or Biopsion powers to their inanimate corpus. Only
intelligent machines can be affected, as the technique
requires a sentient mind to catalyze the effect.
This synergy takes much of its force from the adept. Any System Strain the powers might inflict must
be paid by the adept rather than the target.
Neural Trap
Level-2
The metapsion allows a hostile psychic into their mental sanctum in order to gain a later advantage. When
targeted by a hostile psionic power that allows a save,
the metapsion may Commit Effort as an Instant action
and voluntarily fail the saving throw, accepting the effect. The next psychic power the user targets at that
assailant then allows the victim no saving throw. This
technique lasts until the metapsion makes their psychic
attack or reclaims their Committed Effort. A hostile
psychic may be affected by only one Neural Trap from
a given psychic at a time.

Metapsionics •35

Psychic Static

Level-2

As an Instant action, the metapsion may Commit Effort for the day to negate a perceived psychic power.
The psychic responsible for the effect must Commit
Effort for the day as an Instant action to resist this negation, otherwise the power ends and any action used
to trigger it is wasted. The PC may then Commit Effort for the day again, with each spending and counter-spending until one runs out of Effort or chooses to
stop. Psychic Static can be applied only once per round
to any particular power. The target of the Psychic Static automatically knows the position of the interfering
metapsion, though other onlookers do not have any
obvious way of identifying the metapsion.
Suspended Manifestation
Level-2
The metapsion is capable of “hanging” a psychic power
in their brain, forming the energy patterns and then
suspending them in a self-sustaining loop until it’s time
to trigger their release. The psychic must Commit Effort for the day to hang a power, along with the Effort
normally necessary to trigger it. None of this Effort can
be recovered until the power is expended, after which
it recovers at its usual speed. Activating the power is
an Instant action, or an On Turn action if it allows the
target a saving throw of some kind. Only one ability
can be held suspended at any one time.

Psychic Tutelage

Level-3

An expert metapsion can modulate and temper the
metadimensional energy that surges through an untrained psychic’s mind. This “safety buffer” allows the
novice to experiment with their abilities and gradually
develop the control they need to channel their powers
without causing permanent brain damage. Without
this technique, it is virtually impossible to turn a normal with untapped potential into a trained psychic.
An adept with Metapsionics-3 skill can train up to
ten pupils at once. One with Metapsionics-4 can train
up to one hundred. It requires only a week to train a
potential in ways to avoid accidentally triggering their
powers and suffering the damage that follows, but actually teaching them to use their powers effectively takes
anywhere from one to four years depending on their
natural aptitude and the availability of other psychics
willing to assist the metapsion in the training process.
Surge Momentum
Level-3
The metapsion’s abilities can be reinforced with a degree of metadimensional energy that would cause substantial damage to a less adept mind. Particularly weak
or unprepared minds might be completely crushed by
the force of the adept’s augmented will.
The adept must Commit Effort for the day when
using a power that normally grants its target a saving
throw. The target then suffers a penalty equal to the
adept’s Metapsionics skill on any saving throw normally granted by the power. If the target’s hit die total or
character level is less than half the adept’s level, rounded up, they automatically fail their saving throw.

Concert of Minds
Level-3
As an On Turn action, the metapsion may Commit
Effort and form a psychic gestalt with one or more
willing psychics within three meters, including up to
one other psychic per Metapsion skill level. This gestalt persists as long as the Effort remains committed,
regardless of the subsequent distance between psychics.
On their own turn, any member of the gestalt may use
any power or technique known by any other member,
using the other member’s skill levels as necessary and
paying any Effort cost from their own pool. This gestalt
shares only psychic power, not thoughts or senses. At
the end of each round in which one or more members
have used some other member’s powers or abilities on
their turn of action, the metapsion must Commit Effort
for the scene or the gestalt drops and cannot be re-established for the rest of the scene.

Flawless Mastery
Level-4
When this technique is learned, the adept may choose
one technique from any discipline they know. That
technique no longer requires Effort to be Committed in
any way, though other techniques that augment it may
still exact a cost. Mastered Psychic Static, for example,
can expend an effectively unlimited amount of effort.
If the technique has a duration based on Committed
Effort then it lasts until the metapsion chooses to end it
or is killed. This technique may only be mastered once,
though the perfected technique may be changed with
a month of meditation and practice.

Metadimensional Friction
Level-3
As a Main Action, the metapsion Commits Effort for
the scene to create localized MES turbulence around a
visible target psychic within 200 meters. Each time the
target Commits Effort or an NPC initiates a psychic
power, they suffer 1d8 damage per Metapsionics skill
level of the adept. Each time the target suffers the damage they can attempt a Mental saving throw to throw
off the effect. It lasts no longer than the rest of the scene
at most. Only one application of this friction can affect
a target at once.

Impervious Pavis of Will
Level-4
When this technique is learned, the metapsion must
choose a discipline. They then become entirely immune to unwanted powers from that discipline; they
and their abilities are simply not valid targets for purposes of that discipline’s powers unless the adept chooses to be affected. By Committing Effort for the day as
an Instant action, they can extend this immunity for a
scene to all allies within 50 meters. This technique may
be learned more than once, and any shared protection
applies to all disciplines negated by the adept.

36• Precognition

Precognition
The discipline of Precognition relates to sensing the
cascade of future events and reading the achronal chaos of the metadimensional energy that ripples in the
psychic’s brain. Readings provided by Precognition
tend to be focused on the psychic and what they find
interesting or important. Matters irrelevant to the seer
are unlikely to be noticed, even if they are of critical
importance to those involved. More advanced techniques of Precognition can even influence the future,
adjusting probabilities by changing or pruning certain
metadimensional currents.
The future is not carved in stone. Oracles can be
falsified by present action or sheer random chance.
When a reading is ambiguous or the future seems uncertain, the GM should simply give the most probable
reading for the power as their own judgment recommends.
Precognition is strictly future-oriented. For assorted complex reasons, the past is vastly more difficult
to observe with psionic powers, and postcognition is
generally considered impossible.
Precogs are generally viewed with considerable
unease by the general population. They’re not as widely
feared as telepaths, but the uncanny powers of foresight
they possess can make them difficult company. They
can earn very substantial sums of money from those
desperate to learn of some future outcome, but the
specificity of their visions makes it difficult for them
to perceive large-scale future events.
A precog can see a city in flames or a stock market
board showing a crash, but even the most powerful
can’t tell if the conflagration is just a limited local disaster or a planet-consuming catastrophe, nor can they tell
if the crash is a temporary pullback in the market or a
harbinger of global depression. Many precogs have difficulty dealing with this ambiguity, and some become
fixed on personal interpretations of their visions that
may or may not play out as they have seen.

Bending the Future

Everything a precog sees is provisional. Some outcomes
may be so likely as to be nigh-certain, but nothing is
truly, absolutely destined. Vigorous activity or simple
unexpected chance can skew future outcomes.
This effect is one reason why choirs of precogs
have not been more widely exploited by planetary
governments. The clearer and more detailed a future
outcome becomes, the simpler it is to find the crucial
events that can be changed to derail it. The more intense the precognitive focus toward a future event,
the more fluid it becomes as fresh readings take into
account the countermoves that others have made. Rumors persist of ancient pretech augmentation hardware
that can “fix” future outcomes, but most governments
lack the resources to even consider such extravagance.

Core Technique- Oracle

The precog gains a progressively-greater intuitive understanding of their own future. Each invocation of
the Oracle technique requires a Main Action and that
the user Commit Effort for the day. Once triggered,
the adept gets a single brief vision related to the question about the future that they’re asking. This vision
is always from their own personal vantage point and
never reveals more than a minute of insight, though
the psychic processes it almost instantly as part of the
power’s use.
The GM should answer the question as if the
PC were about to perform the act or engage in the
investigation pertinent to the question. Thus, if the
adept wanted to know what pressing a button would
do and the GM knows that it’s connected to a bomb,
the psychic might get a vision of sudden death. If the
bomb were on a time delay that extended past the time
horizon of the oracle, however, the psychic might just
see a vision of herself waiting patiently, with nothing
happening.
Visions should relate to actions and events, not
abstract facts. Oracle couldn’t tell a psychic who the
crime boss of a slum neighborhood is, for example, but
it could give a vision of the psychic caught in the next
bloody riot and the gang boss who’s directing the myriad thugs. It couldn’t reveal the name of a security guard,
but it could show the seer the impending moment that
the next guard patrol will enter the area the psychic
plans to infiltrate. Only the most important or significant information is conveyed by the technique, even if
multiple events of interest might transpire during the
time horizon.
Oracle can only be used on a given question or topic
once until the situation changes substantially or a week
goes by. The maximum time horizon of the Oracle increases as the adept’s Precognition skill improves.
Level-0: One minute into the future.
Level-1: One day into the future.
Level-2: One week into the future.
Level-3: Three months into the future.
Level-4: One year into the future.
Intuitive Response

Level-1

As an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for
the scene just before they roll initiative. Their initiative score is treated as one better than anyone else’s
involved in the scene. If another participant has this
power or some other ability that grants automatic initiative success, roll initiative normally to determine
which of them goes first, and then the rest of the combatants act. This ability cannot be used if the precog
has been surprised.

Precognition •37

Sense the Need

Level-1

Cursed Luck

Level-3

At some point in the recent past, the psychic had a
vague but intense premonition that a particular object
would be needed. By triggering this power as an Instant
action and Committing Effort for the day, the psychic
can retroactively declare that they brought along any
one object that they could have reasonably acquired
and carried to this point. This object must be plausible
given recent events; if the psychic has just been stripsearched, very few objects could reasonably have been
kept, while a psychic who’s just passed through a weapons check couldn’t still have a loaded laser pistol.

Negative probabilities are woven tightly around a visible animate target, including robots and animals but
not including vehicles. Triggering this technique requires a Main Action and Committing Effort for the
scene. The target must roll any attack rolls, damage
rolls, skill checks, and saving throws twice and take the
worst result each time. Any attempts to hit the target
or damage dice rolled against it may be rolled twice and
the better result taken. Intelligent targets can make a
Mental saving throw at the end of each round to throw
off the effect; this save is not penalized by the power.

Terminal Reflection
Level-1
The psychic’s Oracle power automatically triggers as an
Instant action moments before some unexpected danger or ambush, giving the precog a brief vision of the
impending hazard. This warning comes just in time to
avoid springing a trap or to negate combat surprise for
the precog and their companions. If the psychic does
not immediately Commit Effort for the day, this sense
goes numb and this technique cannot be used for the
rest of the day.

Forced Outcome
Level-3
Through careful manipulation of probability, the adept
can influence random physical events in their vicinity.
Triggering this technique requires a Main Action and
Committing Effort for the scene. Any simple, random
mechanical outcome can be completely controlled for
the scene, such as a roulette wheel or the order of a
deck of shuffled cards. Any other physical event in the
area that seems not-entirely-implausible may be made
to occur by this technique, provided it doesn’t involve
more than a few objects and doesn’t require human
involvement. The GM decides what random events are
and are not adequately possible. Anything more than
one unusual coincidence or chance per scene is likely
impossible to produce.

Alternate Outcome
Level-2
The precog can sense impending failure and attempt
to salvage the action. As an Instant action, the precog
can target a visible ally or their own self and Commit
Effort for the day to allow the target to reroll a failed
hit roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better
of the two rolls. This power disrupts delicate lines of
probability, however, and cannot be used on any given
target more than once a day.
Destiny’s Shield
Level-2
The precog observes an incoming injury and tries to
find an alternate future in which the attack misses. As
an Instant action, the precog can Commit Effort for
the day to force an attacker to reroll a successful hit
roll. This technique only works on attacks against the
psychic’s person, not against attacks aimed at a vehicle
they’re occupying or harm that doesn’t involve an attack roll. If the rerolled attack still hits, however, the
damage done is maximized. This technique can be used
only once per incoming attack.
Anguished Vision
Level-3
The adept’s precognition is sophisticated enough to
clearly foresee several seconds into the future. As an
Instant action, the psychic may Commit Effort for the
day and declare that what they have just done or seen
is a vision of the immediate future. Time rolls back
to the start of the initiative count in a combat turn,
or six seconds earlier if out of combat. Nothing that
happened during that round has really come to pass yet.
This ability is tremendously draining, and can be
used only once per day.

Not My Time
Level-4
The precog instinctively wrenches the lines of probability away from futures in which they are about to die.
This technique triggers automatically when the precog is about to die, provided they can Commit Effort
for the day. On triggering, random events somehow
conspire to leave the precog alive, even if outrageous
coincidences and ridiculous luck are required. Provided
the precog doesn’t intentionally thrust herself back into
danger, their life is secured for the next few minutes at
least, though there’s no guarantee the psychic will survive intact in mind or body. This technique can trigger
no more often than once per week.
Prophecy
Level-4
The power of the precog extends to dictating future
events that directly involve them. As a Main Action,
the precognitive PC may make one prediction involving their personal future or future condition within
the next year. Provided they take reasonable measures
to enable this prediction, that no direct resistance is
mounted by an enemy, and that the prediction doesn’t
seem highly improbable to the GM, it will come to pass.
The adept must Commit Effort when this power is used,
and the Effort remains Committed until the prophecy
comes to pass or is abandoned. This ability cannot be
used more than once per month and only one prophecy
may be active at a time.

38• Telekinesis

Telekinesis
Telekinetic abilities are something of a mixed blessing to those psychics who have them. While they
are among the least feared and distrusted of psychic
powers, they also produce effects that are not nearly
so widely-demanded as biopsionic healing or metapsionic brainguarding. A telekinetic must be canny and
creative to get the most from their abilities.
Telekinetic powers are strong but somewhat imprecise. The force they generate is usually invisible,
though a psychic can allow a visible glow if desired, and
the source of the telekinetic manipulation is not obvious to ordinary senses. Objects being held or worn by
a mobile creature cannot normally be manipulated by
telekinesis, nor can unwilling intelligent targets be directly manipulated. Machines, including non-sentient
robots, can be affected as any other inanimate object,
however. The psychic cannot use this discipline to lift
their own person without special techniques.
Some techniques refer to a “physical attack” or
“physical damage”. This means a straightforward kinetic
impact: bullets, punches, collisions, falls, compressions,
or the like. Energy attacks are not included.

Core Technique- Telekinetic Manipulation
The adept may Commit Effort for the scene as a Main
Action to direct telekinetic force toward an object or
person within unaided visual range or with tactile
contact with the psychic. This force isn’t responsive
enough to be effective as a weapon without further
refinement of technique, and cannot cause damage to
living or mobile targets. If used to crush or harm immobile unliving objects, it does 1d6 damage per skill
level of the psychic per round of focus. Objects move at
20 meters per round when moved telekinetically.
A telekinetic force can be maintained over multiple rounds without expending further actions, such as
holding a metal platform in place under a group of allies, but the psychic cannot again activate this technique
on a second object until they release the first.
Level-0: The psychic can exert force as if with one hand
and their own strength.
Level-1: The psychic can manipulate objects as if with
both hands and can lift up to two hundred kilograms with this ability.
Level-2: The psychic can lift or manipulate up to four
hundred kilograms and smash a human-sized
hole in structures of light wooden construction
or lighter as a Main Action.
Level-3: The psychic can manipulate up to eight hundred kilograms and can affect as many individual
objects at once as they have Telekinesis skill levels.
Level-4: The psychic can manipulate up to a metric ton
and can smash human-sized holes in TL4-constructed exterior walls, light stone walls, or similar
barriers as a Main Action.

Kinetic Transversal
Level-1
The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to
move freely over vertical or overhanging surfaces as if
they were flat ground, crossing any solid surface strong
enough to bear five kilos of weight. They can also move
over liquids at their full movement rate. This movement ability lasts as long as the Effort is committed.
Pressure Field
Level-1
As an Instant action, the adept can manifest a protective
force skin around their person equivalent to a vacc suit,
maintaining pressure and temperature even in hard
vacuum conditions. They can ignore temperatures at
a range of plus or minus 100 degrees Celsius and automatically pressurize thin atmospheres for breathability,
or filter particulates or airborne toxins. By Committing
Effort for the scene, they can shield up to six comrades.
This lasts until the user reclaims the Effort.
Telekinetic Armory
Level-1
The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to
create both weapons and armor out of telekinetic force.
These weapons are treated as tech level 4 and act as a
rifle or any advanced melee weapon. Attack rolls can
use either Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution modifiers, and may use the Telekinesis skill as the combat skill.
Armor may be created as part of this power, granting the psychic a base Armor Class equal to 15 plus their
Telekinesis skill level. This armor does not stack with
conventional armor, but Dexterity or shields modify
it as usual. The gear continues to exist as long as the
psychic chooses to leave the Effort committed, and they
may be invisible or visible at the psychic’s discretion.
Impact Sump
Level-2
The adept may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant
action to negate a single instance of physical damage.
This ability is too taxing to be used more than once per
day, but as an Instant action, it can be triggered even
after damage is rolled.
Slip Field
Level-2
As a Main Action, the psychic Commits Effort for the
scene and decreases the friction at a point in sight. Up
to ten meters in diameter is affected, making it difficult
for enemies to move from their current position. All
chosen targets must make an Evasion saving throw or
fall prone, becoming unable to stand up or move more
than a meter per Move action taken. If used against a
ground vehicle, the driver must make a Dex/Pilot skill
check at a difficulty of 8 plus the adept’s Telekinesis
skill or go out of control, driving directly forward for
a round and crashing into any obstacles. Targets who
save are immune to this technique for the scene.

Telekinesis •39

Telekinetic Expertise

Level-2

The adept has become familiar enough with the manipulation of telekinetic force that they may now use
Telekinetic Manipulation without Committing Effort.
Thermokinesis
Level-2
Telekinetic power involves kinetic energy, but a sufficiently sophisticated grip on motion can be used to
agitate the molecules of an inanimate object and cause
it to melt or burst into flame. Similar focus can chill or
freeze such substances.
Applying Thermokinesis to a target requires that
the adept Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action.
Thermokinesis cannot affect objects larger than the adept
could lift with their Telekinetic Manipulation.
As with other telekinetic powers, this ability does
not work on objects being held or used by intelligent
creatures. Non-sentient robots or other objects with hit
points take 1d12 damage per level of Telekinesis skill
each time this technique is applied to them.
Tangible Force Construct
Level-3
Once per turn, as an On Turn action, the psychic can
Commit Effort for the scene to create a telekinetic force
construct at a visible point, provided it can fit within
a three-meter cube. The force construct can be shaped
in any way the psychic wishes, and can remain fixed in
its location without external supports if desired. It is
as sturdy as a TL4 construction and may be visible or
invisible at the adept’s choice. The construct lasts until
the end of the scene, until the psychic dispels it, or until
it is smashed with 20 points of damage against AC 15.
Telekinetic Ram
Level-3
As a Main Action, the psychic can Commit Effort for
the scene to target a tremendous, uncontrolled burst of
force at a single target within sight. This burst requires
some time to detonate, however, and will only go off
at the end of the next round. Targets of this technique
are aware of an oppressive, electrical tingling in the air
and are apt to instinctively move; this technique is thus
generally useless against any target that is not entirely
immobile, as any movement of a chosen target disrupts
the ram. Once the ram detonates, however, it is sufficient to destroy any immobile civilian vehicle, create a
five-meter hole in anything short of hardened military
fortifications, or inflict 5d12 damage on anything else
as if it were struck by a Heavy weapon.
Reactive Telekinesis
Level-3
As an Instant action, the psychic can Commit Effort for
the scene whenever an assailant misses them with a
physical attack. The attack is then reflected back against
the assailant, who must reroll the attack against their
own person twice. If either roll hits, the assailant suffers damage from their own attack. If both rolls hit, the
damage is the maximum possible.

Force Puppetry

Level-4

As a Main Action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort for
the day to suborn a visible target’s mobility, whether
robotic, vehicular, or human, provided it’s no larger
than a ground car. A sapient victim can make a Mental saving throw to resist the psychic onslaught; on a
failure, they lose control of their physical actions. If not
piloted by the telekinetic, the target remains motionless
or continues on its current direction of travel. If the
telekinetic spends a Main Action to control them, they
can be made to perform any physical action that is not
directly suicidal, using the psychic’s skill levels and hit
bonus for any attacks or skill checks they might make.
The puppetry lasts until the end of the scene, until the
target leaves the psychic’s sight, or until a sapient target
believes that their action or inaction is about to get
them killed. The psychic’s control is fine enough to
achieve even very delicate physical motions, but it is
not good enough to control the target’s speech, though
it can keep them silent.
Telekinetic Flight
Level-4
As an Instant action, the telekinetic can Commit Effort
to begin flying, and may extend this effect to up to a
half-dozen unresisting, human-sized allies within 30
meters. While flying, the psychic can move at twice
their normal movement rate in any direction They can
plunge earthward at up to terminal velocity without
harm, and even orbital insertions are survivable with
this power if a vacc suit is available or the Pressure Field
technique is used. Allies must end their turns within 30
meters of the psychic to maintain this flight but control
their own motion. As an Instant, this power may be
triggered in time to negate falling damage. The flight
lasts for as long as the Effort remains Committed.

Bot Scrapping
While telekinetic powers can’t normally be used to
harm an intelligent target without a special technique, non-sentient robots have no such protection. A VI or True AI can create enough metadimensional static with their cognition to prevent
harm from telekinesis, but ordinary guard bots,
servitor droids, or warbots are extremely susceptible to telekinetic destruction.
In most cases, this is as simple a matter as
telekinetically lifting and then dropping the bot. A
psychic can destroy as many such bots in a round
as they can telekinetically manipulate; one for
most, or three or four at higher skill levels. This
also assumes the psychic can lift the bot’s weight.
Some military bots may be resilient enough
to handle this battering, suffering 1d10 damage
per level of Telekinesis skill the psychic possesses.
Most have no such chance of survival.

40• Telepathy

Telepathy
There is no psychic power more threatening and disturbing to normal humanity than that of telepathy.
The prospect of having one’s innermost thoughts and
secrets pried out by imperceptible means is deeply troubling to most men and women, and telepaths are often
given a wide berth by others simply for fear of what
private thoughts they might sift out.
Some worlds that are otherwise accepting of psychic powers go so far as to ban known telepaths and
forbid the teaching of the discipline within their territory. Even those few that do, however, can rarely resist the urge to maintain some “government-approved”
telepathic training program for candidates selected for
their political trustworthiness or powerful backers.
The benefits of having an imperceptible mental spy
are too great for most states to forgo.
Most worlds do not ban telepaths. On these planets, the sheer rarity of psychic powers and the limited
chance that any one individual might be unlawfully
scanned outweigh any fear of unchecked telepathic intrusion. Telepathic testimony is almost never accepted
in a court of law, however, outside of the most psychic-centered societies.
Almost all worlds forbid the uninvited use of telepathic powers on another person. The crime is very difficult to prove, but usually comes with harsh penalties.
Open admission of an illicit scan is generally considered
proof, so PC telepaths are advised to be discreet.
Telepathic shielding devices and substances do
exist in very limited amounts. Even during the height
of the Mandate, such resources were never abundant.
Nowadays, only heads of state and similar elite personages might expect to shelter behind psionics-proof
walls or have devices to alert them to telepathic tampering. Even then, many worlds will simply lack the
pretech artifacts to erect such protection, even for their
most important members.

Using and Detecting Telepathy

Telepathy operates at a very basic level of mental contact, and is not impeded by a lack of shared languages. While the basic forms of telepathy only function
on intelligent creatures, aliens or transhumans with
human-like cognition can be affected. VIs, True AIs,
and other non-biological intelligences are not normally
subject to Telepathy techniques.
Telepathy is a subtle ability, and targets of its technique will not normally be aware of it. Only those with
metapsionic expertise or Telepathy-0 skill or greater
can tell when they’ve been targeted by Telepathy. Others may suspect this influence, particularly if they’re
aware of the existence of psychics and have just done
something utterly inexplicable to their own reasoning.
Certain extremely rare TL5 devices can also alert a target to the presence of telepathic tampering.

Core Technique- Telepathic Contact

The telepath can obtain a progressively-deeper understanding of a sentient target’s thoughts. The target must
be visible or otherwise perceptible to the telepath’s unaided senses. Opening a contact requires the telepath to
Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action, and the
contact lasts for a scene at most unless augmented by
other techniques.
The depth of contact that can be made depends on
the psychic’s Telepathy skill. A single contact can use
any or all of the effects permitted to a telepath of the
user’s skill level. Basic forms of contact do not allow for
a saving throw, though more advanced probes allow
the target to make a Mental saving throw to resist. On
a successful save, no form of this technique that allows
a save can be used on them for the rest of the scene.
Level-0: Observe emotional states in a target. Intense
emotions provide a single word or image related
to the focus of the feelings.
Level-1: A shallow gestalt with the target’s language centers allows the telepath to understand any form of
communication made by the target. If the psychic
has the requisite body parts to speak the target’s
language, they can communicate with it in turn.
Level-2: The psychic’s awareness of the target’s surface
cognition is sophisticated enough to read their
current thoughts, though it can’t pick up memories or non-obvious connections. The target gets
a Mental saving throw to resist this.
Level-3: The psychic can drill down into the target’s
memory to get a one or two-sentence answer to
any single question they ask, or receive a single
answering vision of the target’s recollections. The
target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist
this power, and whether or not it succeeds the
contact is automatically ended. It can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again.
Level-4: The psychic instantly gets a full and nuanced
awareness of everything the target can remember
about a particular topic. The target can attempt
a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and
whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended afterwards. It can be re-established,
but only by activating this technique again.
Facile Mind
Level-1
The telepath is practiced at opening a Telepathic Contact,
and need only Commit Effort for the scene to do so, instead of Committing Effort for the day. If contacting an
ally who has practiced the process with the psychic for
at least a week, opening the contact normally requires
no Effort at all. In both cases, if the telepath chooses to
Commit Effort for the day, they can open a Telepathic
Contact as an Instant action rather than a Main Action.

Telepathy •41

Transmit Thought

Level-1

The telepath can send thoughts and images over a Telepathic Contact, allowing two-way communication with
a willing target as an Instant action when desired.
Far Thought
Level-2
Once a telepath has made a Telepathic Contact with a
target, they can thereafter activate the technique whenever that target is within 100 kilometers, whether or
not the psychic knows where they are. At Telepathy-3
the range increases to 1,000 kilometers, and at Telepathy-4 it extends over an entire planet and up to orbital
distances. This distant connection is tenuous, however,
and the psychic cannot use any technique through it
that would allow the target a saving throw to resist.
Suppress Cognition
Level-2
Through intense focus, the telepath can make the target
of a Telepathic Contact simply not think about something, whether that’s the presence of the telepath, the
possibility of committing violence, the absence of important documentation, or any other single potential
action or one specific person. This technique requires
the psychic to Commit Effort for the scene as a Main
Action. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist
this power and become immune to it for the scene. If
failed, the thought remains unthinkable for the rest of
the scene unless the target perceives physical danger or
a traumatic threat to something they prize highly. In
that case, the block instantly dissolves and cannot be
re-established during the scene. Once the effect ends,
the target will remain oblivious to their temporary
fugue unless it is brought to their attention somehow.
Reflex Response
Level-3
As a Main Action, the telepath can Commit Effort for
the day to force a sudden, irrational impulse into the
target of a Telepathic Contact. The target may make a
Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, they will
use their next available action to carry out the impulse
to the best of their ability. This impulse cannot be
self-injurious or harmful to a loved one, but it can be
foolish, reckless, or harmful to others. The target may
not understand why they have done the action, but will
usually attempt to rationalize it as their choice.
Telepathic Assault
Level-3
The telepath Commits Effort for the day as a Main
Action to force a wave of metadimensional energy
through the brain of a Telepathic Contact target. The
assault does 6d6 damage, or 9d6 damage if the telepath
has Telepathy-4 skill. The target may make a Mental
saving throw to halve the damage. This assault cannot
kill a target, but can knock them unconscious for an
hour if they’re reduced to zero hit points, after which
they wake up with one hit point. A victim cannot be
targeted by an assault more than once per scene.

Telepathic Control
Telepathy is not a discipline well-suited to direct
mental control of other beings. While a telepath
can impart urges and thoughts to a target, they
lack the tools to assume direct control of a victim’s
physical actions. The best they can do is implant
ideas in the target’s head and try to hijack the
short-term cognition of the victim.
Persistent legends speak of more direct disciplines practiced during the Mandate’s heyday.
These arts supposedly allowed a psychic to take
direct control of a subject’s physical form, manipulating it with effortless ease to perform whatever
acts the psychic desired. Unlike telepathy, however, these disciplines were unable to touch the
cognitive centers of a target or read their mental
activity. If any such disciplines ever existed, their
possessors are doubtless very discreet with them.

Memory Editing

Level-4

The telepath can make simple edits to the memory of
a target currently linked by a Telepathic Contact. Events
of no more than 24 hours in duration can be erased
from memory, conversations can be created or changed,
new events can be added to a day, or other similar alterations made. The psychic can make these changes
as a Main Action by Committing Effort for the day. If
the psychic doesn’t have a good understanding of the
memories they’re changing, such as might be granted
by the level-4 degree of Telepathic Contact, the edits they
make may not fit well. The target gets a Mental saving
throw to resist editing for the rest of the scene, but on
a failure, they will not notice the changed memories
until given a reason to recollect them.
Unity of Thought
Level-4
The telepath becomes exceptionally skilled at weaving
together multiple allied minds. When they establish a
Telepathic Contact with a willing ally they may bind up to
six willing participants into the same contact without
further Effort. This multi-person link is relatively shallow, and allows only the Instant exchange of thoughts,
images, and sensory impressions. While under its effect, every participant knows the exact location and
condition of all others, and uses the best Initiative roll
of any of them if combat commences. At the table, up
to five minutes of discussion and coordination among
the players can be arranged each round without incurring delays for the PCs. Every combat turn, one gestalt
member of the psychic’s choice gets an extra round of
action to represent the benefits of the perfect coordination of the group. The psychic cannot gain this bonus
round himself. The telepathic link lasts as long as the
psychic initiates no new Telepathic Contact, and it has a
range that extends to any point within a solar system.

42• Teleportation

Teleportation
Teleporters do not provoke the kind of persistent
worry that telepaths induce in most normals, but their
particular gifts cause a more physical concern. An experienced teleporter can reach or see into any location
they’ve ever been; security officials don’t just need to
make sure that no teleporter is in a restricted area, but
that they’ve never been there before at any time. Access
into the most important areas is carefully filtered to
ensure that no outside teleporter ever gets a chance to
see a location they might suddenly appear in several
months or years later.
Most governments with access to trained psychics
will have at least a few expert teleporters on hand to
provide untraceable communications links and superlative infiltrators. Despite their many advantages in intrusion and evasion, however, a teleporter needs the
skills to actually get into a restricted area before they
can take advantage of a quick escape. It’s not unknown
for teleporters to be paired with more conventional
burglars who supply the security-defeating skills and
information-gathering talents that a professional psychic doesn’t always have the time to cultivate.
The criminal applications of teleportation are obvious, as is its utility in surveillance. Some bold teleporters make excellent money as thieves or spies for
whatever employer can afford their exorbitant fees.
The price for their services is invariably high, not only
due to the rarity of experienced teleporters, but due to
the consequences of arrest.
As tempting as the criminal path can be for many
teleporters, most are dissuaded by the penalties. Very
few worlds have prison facilities that are in any way designed to cope with teleporting inmates. On advanced
worlds, this means that criminal teleporters are often
implanted with surgical bombs keyed to explode if they
leave a restricted area or stop receiving a specific signal
from a government transmitter. On primitive worlds,
this means that criminal teleporters face summary execution for any crime more serious than a misdemeanor.
Some devices can be used to defeat teleporters,
creating a curdled patch of metadimensional space
that is impossible to enter or leave via teleportation.
These ancient pretech artifacts are invariably ridiculously expensive in the unlikely case that a planetary
government allows them to remain in private hands at
all, and only the most important figures of an advanced
world will have any access to teleporter-sealed “safe
zones”. Many worlds have no access to such devices at
all, with even princes and potentates left to keep a wary
eye on teleporting psychics. A metapsion brainguard is
the usual low-tech answer to psychic threats, if such an
expensive mercenary can be hired on the world.

Core Technique- Personal Apportation

The teleporter can translocate to another location they
have either occupied before or can see with their unaided vision. Locations are fixed in reference to the nearest
major gravity well. For example, it is not possible to
teleport to the cockpit of a distant moving vehicle they
once occupied, but they can teleport to another point
on a planet’s surface even though the planet has since
moved far through the stellar void.
The core technique allows the teleporter to move
himself and any mass he is able to carry with his own
natural strength. Resisting targets cannot be carried
along, and unresisting ones must be touched. A teleporter can leave any clothing, shackles, adhesions, or
other matter behind when he teleports, but he cannot
leave behind matter that has been inserted into his
body, such as cybernetics or shrapnel. Matter cannot
be partially left behind.
A teleporter will instinctively abort any apportation that would leave him embedded in a solid object
or in an environment of imminent physical harm. Any
Committed Effort on such aborted jumps is wasted, as
is any action spent triggering the power.
The maximum range of Personal Apportation depends on the teleporter’s skill level. Teleporting with
Personal Apportation counts as a Main Action and requires that the psychic Commit Effort for the scene.
Level-0: The psychic can teleport up to 10 meters.
Level-1: The psychic can teleport up to 100 meters.
Level-2: The psychic can teleport up to 10 kilometers.
Level-3: The psychic can teleport up to 1,000 kilometers.
Level-4: The psychic can teleport anywhere on a planet’s surface or near orbit.
Proficient Apportation

Level-1

Personal Apportation now counts as a Move action,
though it still can be performed only once per round.
Apportations of 10 meters or less no longer require
Effort to be Committed, though any augments to the
technique must still be paid for normally.
Spatial Awareness

Level-1

The psychic may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to gain an intuitive 360-degree awareness of their
physical surroundings. The sense is roughly equivalent
to sight out to 100 meters, though it cannot read text
or distinguish colors. It is blocked by solid objects but
is unimpeded by darkness, mist, blinding light, holograms, or optical illusions. The sense lasts as long as the
Effort remains Committed to the technique.

Teleportation •43

Burdened Apportation

Level-2

The psychic can carry willing companions with them
when using Personal Apportation. Up to three human-sized companions and their man-portable gear
may be carried per skill level in Teleportation. Allies
must be within 3 meters of the teleporter to be carried
along. Ordinary inert matter cannot be carried along
unless the psychic is touching it or it’s being carried by
an ally affected by this power. If carrying inert mass, up
to two hundred kilos of objects can be carried per skill
level. Using this technique increases the Effort cost of
Personal Apportation, requiring that an extra point of
Effort be Committed for the day.
Perceptive Dislocation

Level-2

Commit Effort for the day to sense any location the
psychic could teleport to. The psychic perceives the
location as if there, lasting for fifteen minutes at most.
Spatial Synchrony Mandala

Level-3

Expert teleporters can be infuriatingly difficult to pin
down. By Committing an additional Effort for the day
as an Instant action, the adept can use Personal Apportation as an On Turn action, even if they’ve already used it
once this round. Apporting itself costs whatever Effort
it normally would, in addition to any techniques that
augment it. Rift Reduplication can only be triggered once
per round.
If the adept uses their powers to teleport into a
location, perform an action, and then use Rift Reduplication to teleport back out, onlookers in the area will
not have time to react to their action or attack the adept
unless the onlookers have held their action explicitly
to counter the psychic. Enemies who hold their action
this way waste it entirely if the psychic does not give
them a chance to attack or otherwise interfere. Such a
lightning strike may be surprising to onlookers, but it
doesn’t allow enough preparation time to count as an
Execution Attack as described on page 52.

Level-2

The psychic imprints a particular object or person on
their psionic awareness. Provided the object is relatively intact and in range of their Personal Apportation, the
psychic always knows its exact location and can teleport
to within three meters of it with Personal Apportation
even if it has moved from its original location. Imprinting an object requires an hour’s meditation with
it, and only one object can be imprinted at a time. If
imprinting on a person, the target must be willing and
cooperative to make the imprint. Objects must be at
least one kilogram in mass to be effectively tracked.
Effortless Apportation
Level-3
The psychic does not need to Commit Effort to use
Personal Apportation. If the technique is augmented by
other techniques that come with their own extra or increased cost, however, this extra cost must still be paid.
Stutterjump

Rift Reduplication

Level-3

The psychic can instinctively micro-teleport away from
incoming danger. As an On Turn action they may
Commit Effort to begin shifting their spatial position
away from attacks, gaining a base Armor Class of 20
so long as the Effort remains Committed. This Armor
Class is not modified by armor, shields, or Dexterity
modifiers, and the micro-jumps do not significantly
move the psychic from their current location. While
Stutterjump is active, as an Instant action the adept may
Commit Effort for the day to negate a successful hit by
a weapon attack, even after damage has been rolled.
This reflexive defensive jump may be used only once
per day and leaves the psychic just outside the radius
of explosions or other area-effect attacks.

Deep Intrusion

Level-4

The adept can use Personal Apportation to blind-teleport
into a building, structure, vehicle, or spaceship visible
to them, including spaceships close enough to engage
in conventional ship-to-ship combat. They intuitively
seek out a space large enough to hold them and without
immediate environmental hazards, but cannot control
their precise destination. Using this technique in conjunction with Personal Apportation is very draining to
the psychic, and requires that they Commit an additional Effort point for the day.
Offensive Apportation

Level-4

The psychic can use Personal Apportation as a Main Action to teleport an unwilling target, provided the user
can make physical contact with them. Contact with an
unsuspecting or incapacitated target is automatic, while
touching a resisting enemy requires a Punch hit roll
with a bonus equal to the psychic’s Teleportation skill.
If the psychic does not use the Burdened Apportation
technique then only the target is teleported; otherwise
the user may go along with them. The psychic cannot
teleport a target to any location they could not teleport to, including locations of imminent environmental danger, such as high in the air, into a windowless
tomb, or into the middle of a sea. A conscious, resisting target can make a Mental saving throw to forcibly
abort the teleportation, rolling at a penalty equal to
the psychic’s Teleportation skill. Use of this technique
adds to the cost of Personal Apportation, requiring the
psychic Commit an additional point of Effort for the
day whether the touch hits or not.

SYSTEMS
Even the most capable interstellar adventurer sometimes encounters a situation where the outcome is by
no means certain. When an alien assassin thrusts a
blade at an unguarded back, or the ship threatens to
careen out of control in a gas giant’s upper atmosphere,
or when the hero has been critically injured and lies
bleeding on a cavern floor, how do you tell what’s going
to happen next? This chapter provides you with certain
basic systems you can use to resolve these questions.

The Basic Mechanics

The three primary systems that most heroes are going to interact with most often are skill checks, saving throws, and combat rounds. Every player and GM
ought to read those sections and understand the basic
mechanisms involved, because they’re going to be seeing a lot of them in their star-faring adventures.
Skill checks tell you whether or not your hero succeeds at a particular feat of expertise or natural competence. Whenever it’s uncertain whether or not your
hero can manage a feat, your GM might call for a skill
check. Failure at the roll means that your hero either
botched it outright, succeeded in a way that was singularly unhelpful, or was foiled by some unexpected
outside influence.
Saving throws tell you whether or not your hero
evades some immediate peril. If you need to know
whether or not the alien insect’s poison overwhelms
you, or if you can dive away from the grenade before
it explodes, or if the villainous psychic’s mind-reading
powers can pry out your secrets, you make a saving
throw. The GM will tell you when you should be making one.
Combat rounds tell you whether or not your hero
has shot, stabbed, exploded, maimed, punched, or otherwise ventilated their foe, and whether the foe has
managed to do the same to them. Combat in Stars
Without Number is very dangerous, especially to novice
adventurers and ordinary NPCs. One thug with a pistol
and a steady hand can kill most newly-minted heroes
with a single well-aimed bullet, and most normal men
and women have even less of a chance against lethal
violence. Warrior heroes and others with a specific talent for combat are more durable against these martial
perils, but even they have to respect the threat of a mob
of angry spearmen or a sniper rifle’s crosshairs.
The combat section is a particularly important
read if your own gaming history has lent itself more
towards games that have very sturdy protagonists or
narratively-shielded player characters. A first-level
Warrior in Stars Without Number is lethally dangerous
to an ordinary street thug or faceless enemy minion,
but three or four mooks with street-built slugthrowers
are likely to put that budding hero down hard. More
experienced PCs gain a larger margin of safety as they

gain more hit points, but there’s no PC that can laugh
off a dozen combat infantrymen with mag rifles and a
will to use them. Don’t assume your character is going
to survive an experience just because they’re a PC.

Using the Systems

Stars Without Number is built to support a sandbox
gaming experience, and the systems in this chapter
are part of that. By default, they’re meant to be fair,
understandable, and flexible enough to be applied to
many situations. They’re not meant to especially favor the PCs, however, or to give them ways to bypass
the results of some poor decision or unlucky moment.
There is no “narrative currency” the player can spend
to avert disaster. This is not the only way a group can
play the game, but it is intentionally the default mode.
It’s not that these systems are perfect, but that
they are an unbiased third party to your gaming session. When the GM calls for a skill check, or rolls a hit
roll for an alien warlord’s chainaxe, he honestly doesn’t
know what’s going to happen. His judgment might apply bonuses or penalties to the dice, or he might choose
to tweak the system to fit the immediate situation, but
ultimately the dice are resolving the situation. This is
important for a sandbox game, because the dice are as
fair as they are merciless.
This fairness adds surprise and interest to a night’s
gaming. Even the GM isn’t completely certain what’s
going to happen when the PCs forge ahead, and this
surprise and novelty help keep the GM interested in
events, and not just a programmatic maestro for preset situations and outcomes. Every gaming session is
a chance for something unexpected to boil out of a
chance throw of the dice, whether that happens when
the PCs catastrophically botch their attempt to defuse
a nuclear fission bomb or when that alien warlord just
happens to catch a ten-kilo demolitions charge with
his chestplate. Even when cruel dice fell a heroic PC,
that very degree of danger helps make the rest of the
party’s survival more meaningful. They lived because
they made good choices and had a bare minimum of
luck, not because they were the designated heroes.
Not all groups will want to play the game this way,
however, and that too is perfectly acceptable. Some
groups do want to let Fate weigh in on their side, and
let death and disaster have to get through a little more
narrative armor first. A GM running a game like this
can often produce this effect without the need for explicitly changing die rolls or introducing destiny chips,
simply by deciding on gentler outcomes for failures,
minimizing murder-obsessed enemies, and explicitly
arranging escape routes for overmatched PCs. This
game belongs to you and your group, and you should
run it the way you want it to be run.

46• Systems

Scenes and Durations
Many psychic abilities and other powers have durations
expressed in scenes. A scene is just a shorthand concept
for a particular action sequence or exertion on the part
of the PCs. A single combat encounter is a scene, as is
the infiltration of a building, the ascent of a radioactive
mountainside, or a tense meeting with an alien overlord’s cybernetic representative. Most scenes don’t last
for longer than fifteen minutes or a single contiguous
chunk of action, but the maximum duration is up to
the GM’s discretion. It’s quite possible to have an eve-

ning’s play where most of the time isn’t tracked, only
marking scenes for important negotiations, gunfire, or
time-critical feats of skill.
Some powers are limited to being used only so
many times in a given scene, or require Effort expenditures that only come back at the end of the scene.
Outside of situations where close time-tracking is important, you can assume that these powers can be used
or that the Effort comes back about once every fifteen
minutes, assuming the PC has intervals for rest.

Saving Throws
There are times when misfortune or unpredictable peril befalls a hero. Only luck or their own natural hardiness can save them from disaster, and to do so they
must make a saving throw.
Saving throws come in three kinds. Physical saves
relate to challenges of physical endurance such as poisons, diseases, radiation, or dire exhaustion. Evasion
saves involve dodging explosions, evading falling hazards, diving back from a crumbling surface, or otherwise exerting one’s powers of speed and swift reaction.
Mental saves relate most often to psychic influences,
hallucinations, esoteric mental control technologies,
and other perils that assault a hero’s mind or perceptions. Mental saves can also be used when no other
saving throw category seems to apply and only blind
luck and ineffable intuition can save the hero.

Your character’s saving throw scores start at 15,
and decrease by one point each time you advance a
level. Each saving throw is modified by the best modifier of two different attributes: Physical by the better
of Strength or Constitution, Evasion by the better of
Dexterity or Intelligence, and Mental by the better of
Charisma or Wisdom. Thus, a first-level PC with a
Strength of 5 and a Constitution of 14 would have a
Physical save of 14.
To make a save, roll 1d20 and try to equal or beat
the appropriate saving throw score. On a success, you
evade or mitigate the peril, while on a failure it takes
full effect. A natural roll of 1 is always a failure, and a
natural roll of 20 is always a success.
The GM decides when a saving throw is appropriate. Some dangers might not allow one at all.

Poison and Peril
While cutting their way through the blue jungles
of Qinglin, a luxuriant blossom of cerulean crystal
catches Eden’s eye. The young adventuress is eager
to find something to make their reeking weeks in
this azure Hell worthwhile for her and her brother
Randall, but she’s no fool, and promptly extends her
3.048-meter probe pole to gently joggle the bloom
from a safe distance away.
The two adventurers are so focused on their
examination of the flower that they risk missing the
stealthy creep of a many-legged creature that approaches through the undergrowth. The GM calls
for Wis/Notice skill checks from both of the PCs.
Eden’s Wisdom modifier of +0 and lack of the Notice
skill leave her with a -1 penalty. She rolls 2d6 and
gets a 6. Her brother Randall has a Wisdom modifier
of +1 and Notice-0 skill, which gives him a net +1
bonus on his roll, and a result of 11.
The GM decides that sneaking through the
undergrowth is a sort of thing that venomous alien
hunters would be good at, so he applies the creature’s

+1 skill bonus to its own stealth roll. Unfortunately
for the young heroes, it rolls a 12, approaching the
pair undetected.
The GM rolls randomly to see which of the pair
is closest and finds that Randall is the unlucky winner. The dog-sized monstrosity leaps on the psychic
and stabs him with its venomous proboscis.
The GM knows that the poison of this dread
beast is enough to kill an unlucky victim in a matter
of minutes. But did Randall receive a lethal dose? He
asks Randall’s player to make a Physical saving throw.
The psychic’s Physical saving throw target is 14,
so his player reaches for a d20 and rolls, coming up
with a natural 20 on the dice. A natural 20 is always
a success, even if penalties would otherwise make
the roll a failure.
Randall staggers under the attack, but most of
the beast’s poison stains his armor harmlessly. He’s
shaky, but can push through the dose he got with no
ill effects. That’s a good thing, because that scuttler’s
egg-mate is hurrying up through the brush…

Skill Checks •47

Skill Checks
Most characters are skilled, competent men and women who are perfectly capable of carrying out the ordinary duties of their role. Sometimes, however, they are
faced with a situation or challenge beyond the usual
scope of their role and must make a skill check.
To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most
relevant skill level and attribute modifier. If the total is
equal or higher than the check’s difficulty, the check is a
success. On a failure, the PC either can’t accomplish the
feat at all or they achieve it at the cost of some further
complication to the situation. The GM determines the
specific outcome of a failure.
If the character doesn’t even have level-0 in the
pertinent skill, they suffer a -1 penalty to the roll. In
the case of particularly technical or esoteric skills they
might not even be able to attempt the skill check at all.
Some checks might be suitable for more than
one skill. A javelin-throwing contest might use Exert
for being an athletic contest, or Shoot for involving a
ranged weapon, or Stab for using a muscle-powered
thrown weapon. In such cases the PC can use the best
applicable skill. In other situations, a skill might seem
peripherally relevant; trying to find the hidden bomb
in a starship’s engine core before it detonates might certainly use Notice or Fix, but a GM might also let Pilot
be applied, as a veteran pilot might be expected to know
what their engine should look like. In such peripheral
cases, the check difficulty usually increases by 2.

8

Skill Check Difficulties
A relatively simple task that is still more than
the PC would usually be expected to manage
in their regular background. Anything easier
than this isn’t worth a skill check.
A significant challenge to a competent professional that they’d still succeed at more often
than not.

10

Something too difficult to be expected of
anyone but a skilled expert, and even they
might fail.

12

Only a true master could expect to carry this
off with any degree of reliability.

14+

Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at all, and even they will probably fail.

Particularly helpful or hostile circumstances might
give a bonus or penalty to the skill check. As a general
rule, extremely bad circumstances or tools would apply up to a -2 penalty to the skill check, while a very
good situation or the perfect set of tools might give up
to a +2 bonus to the roll. Usually, no combination of
modifiers should add more than +2 or -2 to any given
skill check.

When To Call for a Check

Skill checks should only be called for challenges that fall
outside the PC’s background and common experience.
A PC with the background of a starship pilot should
not be rolling skill checks to land a ship or navigate to
an in-system destination. As a general rule of thumb,
if failure at a particular task would make the PC seem
notably incompetent at their role in life, then they
shouldn’t have to roll a skill check for it. In addition, if
failure or success at a check really doesn’t matter in the
game, if it won’t produce some interesting result either
way, then a check shouldn’t be made.
Even concept-related feats might require a skill
check, however, if the situation is especially bad or
the circumstances particularly hostile. The pilot might
have to make a Pilot skill check to land a ship if they
attempt it in the middle of a man-killing sandstorm,
and a noble might have to make a Connect skill check
to find shelter with an aristocratic relation if they’re
currently wanted by the stellar tyrant’s guards.

Aiding a Skill Check

Sometimes one PC will want to lend a hand to another
as they attempt a difficult feat. To do this, the player
first describes what sort of action they are taking to
help their comrade. If the GM agrees that their effort
makes sense and would be helpful, the player then rolls
a relevant skill check against the same difficulty as the
original check. If it’s a success, the other PC gets a +1
bonus on their roll. Multiple PCs can try to help, but
the acting PC can’t earn more than a +1 total bonus.
The helping skill doesn’t necessarily have to be the
same skill the PC is checking. If a player can think of
a way to help a Sneak check with Talk, then so be it.

Opposed Skill Checks

Sometimes a PC wants to accomplish something that
another character wants to prevent. Sneaking past an
alert guard, winning a shooting tournament, or besting
an alien in a tentacle-wrestling competition might all
be opposed skill checks.
In such cases, all participants roll their relevant
skills and the highest score wins, with ties going to
the PC. To make the NPC’s roll, check their listed skill
bonus; they can add it to any skill check appropriate to
their role or profession. If the NPC has no reason to
be particularly good at the challenge, they simply roll
2d6 and add nothing.
In most cases, the relevant skills are obvious. A
character trying to skulk past a vigilant guard would be
rolling their Dex/Sneak against the guard’s roll, while
one trying to out-tentacle an alien would be rolling Str/
Exert. When in doubt, the GM decides which skill is
most applicable.

48• Combat

Combat
Sometimes the only reasonable response to a situation
involves drawn monoblades and heavy plasma fire. In
such unfortunate hours your heroes will have to engage in combat.
Combat in Stars Without Number is a lethal sort of
experience, especially for novice interstellar adventurers. Even hardened Warriors can go down in a hurry
under a withering hail of mag rifle fire or the scrapsteel knives of a hiveworld gang pack. PCs should be
very certain that the odds are in their favor before they
reach for their laser pistols, and even then, the gods of
battle can be cruel.

Rounds and Initiative

Combat and other time-sensitive situations are divided
up into rounds. Each round is approximately six seconds, during which all participants may act. When everyone has acted, the round ends and a new one begins.
To determine who acts first in a round, each participant rolls initiative. Each rolls 1d8 and adds their
Dexterity modifier. NPCs usually have no modifier.
The participants then act in order, high roll to low,
with PCs winning ties. When everyone has had a turn
to act, the sequence starts over again from the top. Initiative is not re-rolled.
Optionally, the GM may choose to use group initiative instead in their campaigns. The PC with the best
Dexterity bonus rolls for the party, and the GM rolls
one die for the other NPCs. Members of the side that
rolled highest may act first in whatever order they wish,
and then the next-highest side acts. While easier to
manage, it also increases the value of winning initiative,
and can leave the heroes in dire peril if a large group
of foes wins the roll.
Sometimes a person is surprised or ambushed.
Most ambushes involve a contested Dex/Sneak roll
against a target’s Wis/Notice check, with the defender
winning ties. In other cases the surprise may be practically inevitable, such as a disguised assassin suddenly
lashing out with a monoblade in the middle of a society
ball. Ambush targets who fail the contested roll are surprised. A surprised target doesn’t get to roll initiative
until the second round of combat and can perform only
Instant actions while surprised. NPCs with roles relevant to being vigilant or stealthy would gain their skill
bonus to these checks, while others would simply roll
an unmodified 2d6 for the opposed check.
Most PCs are not subject to surprise unless their
guard is genuinely down at the moment of the ambush
or attack. Someone walking in a dangerous part of a
city or picking their way through a seemingly-abandoned space station is unlikely to be astonished by the
sudden appearance of danger, unless the attack is so
sudden and from such an unexpected quarter that even
their obvious caution is insufficient.

Types of Actions

When an actor’s turn comes up in the round, they may
perform actions. Actions are divided into four different
types: Main Actions, Moves, On Turn actions, or Instant.
Main Action
One per Turn
Every actor can make one Main Action each round.
Main Actions are those deeds that are going to absorb
most of the six-second round, such as attacking an enemy, bracing a door, applying first aid to a downed ally,
digging a Stowed item out of a pack, manipulating a
complex device, or some other activity that takes up
their focus. In place of their Main Action, an actor can
take a second Move action.
Move Action

One per Turn

Every actor can make one Move action each round,
running up to 10 meters. This movement assumes that
an actor is dodging enemies, paying attention to the
surroundings, navigating awkward terrain, and generally dealing with the hazards of a battlefield. Climbing
a surface, swimming, or passing extremely rough terrain halves this movement rate. Actors can’t split their
Move action, such as taking part of it before using their
Main Action and the rest afterwards.
An actor who wants to disengage from an opponent in melee must use their Main Action to perform
a Fighting Withdrawal, or else they suffer a free automatic melee attack from any foe engaged with them.
There is no need to spend a Main Action disengaging
from enemies who are wielding only ranged weapons.
While it’s possible to use a rifle to buttstroke someone
or pistol-whip a near combatant, such weapons aren’t
as effectively threatening as true melee weapons.
On Turn Action

Any Amount on Your Turn

An On Turn action is some fast, simple act that could
reasonably be performed while an actor is doing something else. Dropping an object, falling prone, saying
something, drawing a Readied item, or activating a
simple device might all be On Turn actions. A PC can
perform as many On Turn actions as they want in a
round, subject to the GM’s discretion.
Instant Action

Any Amount, Any Time

An Instant action is special, in that it can be performed
even when it’s not the actor’s turn, or even after attacks or damage have already been rolled. Some psychic
powers are Instant actions, allowing the actor to use
them after they decide they don’t like how the dice have
fallen. Certain combat actions are also Instant, though
they often cost the actor’s Main Action for the round as
well. Any number of Instant actions can be performed
during a round.

Combat •49

Hitting an Enemy

When an actor wants to hurt a target, they need to use
their Main Action to make an attack roll. An attack roll
represents not just one shot or swing, but the assailant
spending their round trying to get in a good hit or a
clean shot at the target.
To make an attack roll, the assailant rolls 1d20 and
adds their attack bonus, their applicable skill level, and
the attribute modifier most relevant to the weapon.
If the total is equal or higher than the target’s Armor
Class, the attack is successful.
A PC’s attack bonus is usually equal to half their
character level, rounded down. Characters with the
Warrior class or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior class option have higher base attack bonuses. NPCs
have their own attack bonus listed with their statistics,
which includes any modifiers they might have.
A PC’s skill level is their Punch, Stab, or Shoot
skill in most cases, depending on what kind of weapon
they’re using. In rare cases, a different skill might be
involved, such as Pilot for the guns of a light starfighter.
If a PC doesn’t even have level-0 expertise in the type
of weapon they’re using, they suffer a -2 penalty on hit
rolls for unfamiliarity with it.
A PC’s attribute modifier depends on the weapon.
For ranged weapons, this is usually Dexterity, while
smaller melee weapons might use Strength or Dexterity, and large ones might rely on Strength alone. If a
weapon has more than one attribute listed, use the best.

A successful attack inflicts hit point damage equal
to the weapon’s damage die plus the relevant attribute
modifier. Thus, a hero with a +1 Dexterity modifier
firing a laser pistol that does 1d6 damage would inflict
1d6+1 hit points of damage on a hit. Skill levels do not
add to damage unless it is a Punch attack.
Some melee weapons apply Shock, and are guaranteed to do some degree of harm to a target. A weapon’s
Shock quality lists the number of points of damage it
inflicts on any target with an Armor Class equal or
less than the one given. Thus, a primitive knife with a
Shock score of “1 point/AC 15” would always do at least
1 point of damage whenever its wielder attacks a target
with AC 15 or less, whether they hit or miss.
Shock damage always adds the wielder’s attribute
modifier and any other bonuses that might apply from
weapon mods, foci, or other advanced tech. Some advanced armor will always protect completely against
primitive weapons, however, and some advanced
weapons can ignore primitive gear, treating it as AC 10.
A successful attack doesn’t always mean a direct
physical hit. A flurry of strokes that force an enemy
off-balance, graze him, frighten him, or exhaust him
might all drain his hit points, bringing him closer to
defeat without actually inflicting real physical harm.
Only the last handful of hit points reflect serious bodily
damage. It’s up to the GM and player to decide how to
describe the effects of a successful hit.

Hit Roll Modifiers

Sometimes it can be easier or harder to connect with
a blow depending on the combat situation. The table
below offers some suggested hit roll modifiers for common combat circumstances.
Circumstance

Mod

Shooting at a distant prone foe

-2

Shooting or meleeing an adjacent prone foe

+2

Melee attacking while prone

-4

The target is at least half behind cover

-2

The target is almost completely in cover

-4

Shooting from a prepared firing position

+2

Finding cover is often critical in a gun battle. Generally, firing around a convenient corner or shooting
over sandbags would qualify as half cover, while firing through slits or from carefully-prepared bunkers
would allow for full cover. Melee attackers can usually
ignore cover, as they get too close for their target to
take proper advantage of it. Being prone doesn’t stack
with hard cover, but sometimes the available cover is
so low that the hero has to be flat to benefit from it.
A gunman who can set up a prepared firing position can get a significant advantage. Such a position
usually requires at least five minutes of sighting and setting up a rest. Most such positions provide some cover.

50• Combat

Common Actions in Combat
While a PC can do anything they might reasonably
accomplish in six seconds as their Main Action for a
round, some choices are more common than others.
Below are a list of some of the tactics or actions that
come up most often in combat.
Make a Melee Attack
Main Action
The combatant attacks an enemy within melee range,
rolling a normal hit roll and inflicting damage on a
successful hit. Most melee attacks inflict Shock damage
on a miss, if the target’s Armor Class is low enough, and
no successful hit does less damage than the weapon’s
Shock would have done on a miss. An attacker’s weapon must be Readied in order to attack with it.
Make a Ranged Attack
Main Action
The combatant fires or throws a Readied ranged weapon at a target. The combatant can’t Make a Ranged
Attack with a two-handed weapon if there’s a enemy
armed with a melee weapon within melee range; it’s
too easy for the assailant to bind up a rifle-sized gun.
One-handed ranged weapons and thrown weapons can
still be used, albeit at a -4 penalty to hit.
Make a Snap Attack
Instant Action
A combatant with a Ready weapon can rush their attack,
sacrificing accuracy for speed. The combatant must still
have their Main Action impending or available. As an
Instant, they can sacrifice it to Make a Melee Attack or
Make a Ranged Attack against a foe in range, whether a
snap shot with a pistol or a quick thrust at an adjacent
melee foe. This attack takes a -4 penalty to its hit roll.
If multiple combatants decide to make Snap Attacks at
the same time, they are resolved simultaneously.
Snap Attacks are usually made only by the desperate, the undisciplined, or the elite, and the GM should
rarely have NPCs employ them. Untrained hooligans
might blaze away in excitement or panic, or a gunman
being charged by a howling spearman might risk a shot
before he gets too close, but most combatants can’t afford to take such a heavy penalty to their hit roll. Truly
skilled combatants, however, can sometimes get away
with such risks, particularly if they have a Warrior’s
class ability to turn a miss into a hit.
Total Defense
Instant Action
As an Instant action, the combatant focuses on nothing
other than avoiding knives, gunfire, hurled crystalline
spears, or other perils in the vicinity. Using Total Defense costs the user their Main Action for the round,
and cannot be used if they’ve already employed their
Main Action. They become immune to Shock damage
for the round from melee weapons, regardless of their
Armor Class, and gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class
until their next turn.

Club Up a Weapon
Move Action
A combatant can shift their grip on a Readied rifle or
pistol, using it as a crude melee weapon rather than a
ranged weapon. Rifle-sized guns used this way count
as a medium primitive weapon with no Shock score,
and pistol-sized guns count as a small primitive weapon with no Shock score. Rolling maximum damage on
a hit with such improvised weapons will break them.
This action can also be taken to unclub a weapon and
ready it to shoot.
Run
Move Action
The combatant moves their normal combat movement
rate, which is 10 meters for most humans. If they’re
climbing a surface, swimming, or navigating extremely
rough terrain, this movement rate is halved, and they
might have to make an Exert skill check to achieve even
that. Prone characters crab along at half this rate.
Fighting Withdrawal
Main Action
The combatant disengages from any melee foes around
them. They don’t actually move away, but they can now
get away from their assailants without giving them a
free melee attack. Usually, this means the combatant
uses their Move action to get clear, because if they just
stand there the enemies might choose to re-engage
them the next round.
Use a Skill
Main Action
The combatant uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few seconds. An Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill
check to stabilize a wounded comrade is one such potential use, as is executing a pre-programmed hack,
shouting out a stirring rallying cry to timorous NPC
allies, or anything else that might be done quickly.
Ready or Stow an Item

Main Action

The combatant draws a weapon, extracts an item from
their backpack, digs a magazine out of a belt pouch,
or otherwise moves an object around on their person.
They can Ready an item this way or Stow it.
Reload a Weapon
Main Action
The combatant swaps a Readied power cell or magazine
into their weapon. Some very primitive firearms might
require more than one action to load them, while an
archer can nock another arrow as a Move action.
Drop an Item
Instant Action
The combatant drops something they’re holding. They
can do this Instantly at any time to free up their hands.

Combat •51

Pick up an Item

Move Action

The combatant can scoop an object off the floor if they
have a free hand, leaving it Readied in their grip.
Stand Up
Move Action
The combatant gets up from a prone position. Most
characters that have just been revived from unconsciousness must get up before they do much else.
Go Prone
On Turn Action
The combatant falls flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take a -2 penalty to hit them. Adjacent enemies
find you an easier target, however, gaining +2 to hit.

Hold An Action

Move Action

By choosing to Hold An Action, the combatant can delay
taking the rest of their actions until later in the round,
activating them as an Instant action. Thus, a hero who
wins initiative might use their Move action to Hold An
Action. Later in the round, as an enemy rushes around
a corner, he may Instantly elect to use his Main Action
to Make A Ranged Attack with his readied laser rifle. If
acting in response to someone else’s impending action,
the held action is resolved first.

Examples of Murder
Yaddle and Bort, two drunken hive thugs, get involved in an impromptu knife fight over a card
game. Yaddle wins the initiative roll, but Bort elects
to make a Snap Attack, since Yaddle is within convenient range of Bort’s Readied knife. Incensed, Yaddle
also decides to make a Snap Attack, so the two resolve their attacks simultaneously.
Bort has a hit bonus of +1. Being an NPC, he
doesn’t add skills or attribute modifiers; he just rolls
1d20, adds 1 to it for his attack bonus, and applies a
-4 penalty for a Snap Attack to find the Armor Class
he hits. His modified roll is 11, which is enough to
hit the unarmored Yaddle, who has an AC of 10. Bort
rolls 1d4 for his small, primitive knife, inflicting 3
points of damage. Again, as an NPC, he doesn’t add
attribute modifiers to the damage.
Yaddle has a similar hit bonus, but his modified
roll is 7, less than Bort’s unarmored AC of 10, so he
misses. His primitive knife does do 1 point of Shock
damage to Bort, however, because a small primitive
weapon does its Shock damage to any target with an
AC of 15 or less.
With the attacks resolved simultaneously, both
now take damage. Yaddle takes 3 points, and as he
only had 3 hit points to begin with, he’s down and
dying, spurting from several vicious slashes. Bort
takes 1 damage from Shock, and since he was always
a frail gutter rat with only 1 hit point, he too is down,
slipping into shock from a gash in his belly. Luckily,
he owes an onlooker money, so his creditor rushes
forward and tries to hold Bort’s guts in with his coat.
Stabilizing a mortally wounded target requires
an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check. The creditor
is an NPC, and the GM decides that they have no
particular talent at first aid, so the GM rolls a flat 2d6
for them and gets a lucky 10. That’s just enough to
stabilize Bort even without the help of proper medical supplies, and so the downed victor is carried off
to a an unlicensed street doc for emergency patching.

After a month of recovery, a cocky Bort has
equipped himself with a spiked walking stick, a medium primitive weapon that is “more bashy” than his
small knife. He spots the young PC Warrior gunslinger Eliza Darrick in the grimy hive street and
covets her fine revolver. What better way to acquire
it than to cosh the young woman?
He sidles into position near her before raising
his stick. Eliza has a considerable fund of common
sense and is not subject to surprise at this turn of
events, given the environment. Both roll initiative
and Bort wins. He makes his roll of 1d20+1, no longer rushed by a Snap Attack, and gets a 13.
Eliza has an armored undersuit that grants her
an AC of 13, plus a bonus of +1 for her Dexterity
modifier, for a total AC of 14. As Bort’s roll is lower,
he misses. Because medium primitive weapons only
do Shock to targets with AC of 13 or less, Bort’s stick
doesn’t even do Shock damage to her.
Eliza then draws the Readied revolver that Bort
so coveted and makes her own attack roll of 1d20, +1
for her attack bonus, +1 more for her Dexterity, and
+1 more for her Shoot-1 skill. She rolls a total of 4,
an abysmal showing. As she does not much care for
being jumped by the likes of Bort, she chooses to use
her Warrior class ability to turn a missed shot into a
hit once per scene, sealing Bort’s doom.
With only 1 hit point, it doesn’t even matter
what Eliza might roll for damage. The GM describes
the look of dull surprise on Bort’s face as Eliza’s bullet
plows a wet hole through his chest.
Eliza ducks down a side street as Bort falls to the
filthy asphalt. Even if the GM decided that Bort had
a chance to survive his wound, none of the denizens
around him have any interest in anything but the
contents of his pockets. Bort gurgles out the last of
his life six rounds later, giving fodder for bad dreams
to the scarred urchin who is tugging the stick from
his slackening grip.

52• Combat

Combat Complications and Maneuvers
Players generally seek to wring out every possible advantage in a combat, and that means they’ll often try
unusual maneuvers or add special complications to a
fight. The situations that follow are just some of the
more common circumstances a GM will encounter.

Forcing Enemy Movement

Sometimes the PC will want to shove an enemy into
a firepit, force a foe into an open reactor core spark,
dump an alien chamberpot on their head, or swing
from the balcony down upon an evildoer. Sometimes
these gambits will simply work, while other times a
skill check might be required.
To shove, herd, or otherwise manipulate a foe, the
attacker has to hit them with a Punch attack, doing
no damage, and then win an opposed Punch or Exert
skill check. If they win, the opponent gets moved up
to three meters in the direction the PC wishes or is
knocked prone. Herding a foe with a melee weapon
may also be possible at the GM’s discretion, allowing a
Stab skill check instead of Punch.
When environmental damage is needed for a firepit, dropped object, or inconvenient wall spike, 1d8 is
usually a good choice, with potential ongoing damage
if the victim doesn’t get out. Major foes can handle a
lot of such accidents, while ordinary men and women
might well be taken out of the fight by them.

Disarming a Foe

Wresting a weapon from a hostile wielder is a difficult
feat under the best of circumstances. Still, sometimes
a PC will want to strip their foe of something sharp
or shooty.
Normally it is only possible to disarm a foe when
engaging them in melee combat. Shooting the weapon
out of an enemy’s hand is a popular holovid trope, but it
tends to be less practical on the actual battlefield.
To execute a disarm, the assailant must choose to
spend their Main Action doing so and make a successful
attack roll. If they hit, they do no damage; instead, both
they and their targets make Dex or Strength-modified
skill checks with the weapons they’re using, with the
defender gaining a +3 bonus on the roll. If the attacker
wins the opposed check, the enemy is disarmed. On a
tie, both are disarmed.
Disarmed weapons skitter 1d4 meters away in a
random direction. If the attacker beats the defender by
at least three points on the opposed check, they end
up in control of the weapon if they have a free hand.
Thus, if a bare-handed assailant tried to rip the gun
out of the hands of an enemy alien, the assailant would
need to hit with a Punch attack and then roll either Str/
Punch or Dex/Punch against the alien’s skill check + 3.
If they won, they’d send the gun flying, and if they won
by 3 or more points, they’d end up holding it.

Execution Attacks

Occasionally an assailant will have the chance to perfectly set up a shot against an entirely unsuspecting target. Such surprise attacks can be devastatingly effective,
and are capable of summarily executing almost anyone.
Setting up a killing blow this way requires a full
minute of preparation, whether as a sniper drawing
a bead on a target or an assassin drifting closer to an
unsuspecting politico. Any focused attention on the
assailant will spoil this preparation, as will any action
that alarms the target. Assassins intending a melee attack must be using an adequately lethal weapon, such as
a knife rather than a fist or bludgeon. PCs with special
talents in unarmed combat or murderous blunt weapon
use might be exempt from this at the GM’s discretion.
Once the preparation is complete, a sniper may
shoot or an assassin may attack an adjacent target. The
target’s Armor Class is irrelevant, assuming the weapon being used isn’t too primitive to penetrate high-tech
armor. Hitting with a sniper shot is a Dex/Shoot skill
check, with a difficulty of 6 for a point-blank shot, 8 for
one at the weapon’s normal range, and 10 for a shot at
extreme range. A melee attack always hits, but the assassin must be adjacent to the target, and cannot move
to close on the same round. They must be adjacent and
unsuspected at the start of the round.
If the attack hits, it does maximum damage and
the victim must immediately make a Physical saving
throw at a penalty equal to the attacker’s combat skill
or they will be mortally wounded on the spot. Some
victims might merely be incapacitated instead if such
an outcome was intended and plausible.
Attacking a completely helpless adjacent opponent,
such as one who is unconscious, asleep, thoroughly
bound, or otherwise incapable of self-defense does not
require a hit roll and will leave them mortally wounded.
Player characters are as vulnerable to these rules as
NPCs are, and may be sniped or stabbed if they behave
in sufficiently incautious fashion.

Two-Weapon Fighting

Some players enjoy having their heroes employ two
weapons at once in combat, whether they’re a pair of
knives, a brace of laser pistols, or some other plausible
pairing of weapons.
Dual-wielding requires at least level-1 skill in
Shoot or Stab depending on the weapons used. Novices
cannot effectively dual-wield.
A hero who dual-wields suffers a -1 penalty on
hit rolls due to the extra complication, but gains a +2
bonus on damage rolls on a successful hit. This bonus
doesn’t add to Shock. Only one weapon can be used to
attack in any given round, though either can be used.
Unarmed combatants cannot dual-wield.

Injury, Death, and Healing •53

Injury, Death, and Healing
A creature brought to zero hit points has been defeated
and can no longer fight. If brought to zero hit points by
a lethal weapon, they are dead or dying. Foes brought
down with fists, blunt objects, or other less-than-lethal
means may merely be unconscious or incapacitated, if
their assailant wasn’t trying to kill them. Some enemies
might even be incapacitated by purely mental or emotional strain. Foes defeated non-lethally recover one
hit point after ten minutes and then function normally.
A mortally-wounded creature at zero hit points
will die in no more than six rounds. They may be unconscious, screaming for their mother, trying to press
vital organs back into place, or begging for mercy, but
they can perform no useful action and their fate is sealed
if no immediate aid is provided. Creatures dropped by
Heavy weapons, explosives, or other dramatic injury
may be instantly killed at the GM’s discretion. Additional damage inflicted on a mortally-wounded target
will always kill them immediately.
A PC who wants to extend mercy to an enemy or
aid to a friend can use their Main Action to attempt
an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check, using whatever
modifier is best. If they have no special medical tools
available at all, the difficulty of the check is 10 plus
the number of rounds that have passed since the target
went down. If they have a medical kit or other proper
trauma tools, the difficulty is 8 plus the rounds since
injury, and if they expend a Lazarus patch on the target,
the difficulty is 6 plus the time. A failed check can be

re-attempted next round if the target isn’t dead yet, but
Lazarus patches are expended even on a failure. The
Biopsionic technique Psychic Succor automatically succeeds in stabilizing a target, if any time remains to them.
A critically-injured target who has been stabilized
regains one hit point after ten minutes of recovery.
They are able to move and function normally if they are
fiercely determined to do so, but any further damage
whatsoever will kill them, with no chance for stabilization. If they are healed with some high-tech pharmaceutical stim or advanced Biopsionic technique, they
can shake off this fragility and return to action with
whatever hit points the drug or power have provided.
Without such advanced healing, a critically-wounded
target requires at least a week of bed rest and medical
care before they can shake off their fragility and start
regaining their level in hit points after each night’s rest.
This assumes that TL4 medical care is available. If
only TL3 tech is on hand, the recovery time is a month.
If TL2 or lower medical care is provided, the recovery
time is a month, and the target must make a Physical
saving throw at the end of it, with a bonus equal to the
Heal skill of whoever is tending them. On a success,
they’ll recover within 1d4 more weeks. On a failure,
the primitive technology ensures they’ll die of their
wounds at some point in that time.
Creatures that have suffered damage but have not
been mortally injured regain hit points equal to their
hit dice or character level after each night of good rest.

Desperate Measures
Eliza Darrick is in a bad situation. During the exploration of a lost Mandate research station, an ally
managed to accidentally activate the installation’s
defense systems. A swarm of decaying security bots
almost overwhelmed the group, and a chance shot
from an integral mag rifle has just dropped Eliza.
The gunslinger is on the floor with zero hit
points. If she were an NPC, the shot probably would
have just killed her outright, but as a PC, she has
the hardihood to keep struggling against any wound
a human could theoretically survive. Even so, she’s
going to die in six rounds if nobody comes to her aid.
Big John, an ally of the downed shootist, spends
his Main Action dragging her behind cover as the
rest of the party tries to hold back the metal tide. By
the time he actually gets the chance to try to stabilize
her, a full round has passed since she was felled.
Luckily, Big John has a lazarus patch Readied at
his belt. Unluckily, he has no medical skill whatsoever, though he’s quite intelligent, with a +1 attribute
modifier. He rolls 2d6, -1 for his lack of Heal skill, +1
for his Intelligence modifier, for a total of 6.

Unfortunately, since Eliza has been bleeding out
for one full round, the difficulty of stabilizing her is
7. The patch fails. Big John has another one in his
pack, but it’s going to take him his next round’s Main
Action to dig it out and then another round to try to
apply it, by which time Eliza will have been bleeding
for three rounds and the difficulty will be 9.
The next round, a shout from across the room
alerts Big John that an ally is throwing him something. A stim unit comes skittering across the floor,
and Big John uses a Move action to scoop it up, leaving it Readied in his grip. It’s an ancient Mandate cosmetic stim they looted from the station’s commissary,
and it might just save Eliza’s life.
Big John presses the stim capsule against Eliza’s
neck and the mysterious pretech nanites do their
work, giving her minty-fresh breath for the next six
months. As a side effect, the medical substrate of the
Mandate stim also heals 1d6 damage to her, raising
her to five hit points. Eliza is now prone but fully
revived. Thanks to the advanced healing, she does
not need further rest before returning to action.

54• Hacking

Hacking
In the far future, it’s inevitable that many advanced civilizations will use computers to control their vehicles,
infrastructure, and data stores. It is equally inevitable
that some tech-talented hero will try to use that fact
to get something they want. While hacking has some
significant limitations in what it can accomplish, it can
still be a useful tool for the right kind of hero.

The Digital Environment

Most planets with TL4 or better will rely on computers
to operate their infrastructure and maintain their data.
They may or may not have an internet-like global network depending on their political situation and cultural
values, but individual buildings or data storehouses will
normally have an internal network. If there is no open
planetary internet, a hacker will need to be physically
present in the networked area to hack the system.
Most hacking requires a physical interface with
the system, either through tapping a data line with a
metatool or plugging into a connected terminal. Tapping a data line usually takes at least a minute unless a
special cable-siphon tool is used, while plugging into
a terminal is a Main Action. Some buildings may have
a local wireless network that can be used as an entry
point, and some planetary internets may allow assaults
on arbitrary computers, but such convenient situations
are unusual. Advanced security software usually makes
such remote assaults impractically difficult.
It’s up to the GM to decide what parts of a facility
are susceptible to hacking, and to determine the full
scope of what effects a hacker can produce. A hightech security door in some advanced facility might well
be hackable, but every refrigerator, locked closet door,
and employee bathroom is not necessarily slaved to the
local network.

Executing the Hack

Assuming a hacker is able to make a connection, they
can make an Int/Program skill check to hack the system.
If they’ve spent at least an hour planning this specific
hack, the skill check requires only a Main Action to
execute their prepared code. If they’re performing the
hack off-the-cuff, it takes ten minutes. If they’re rushed
and don’t have time to either prepare the hack or spend
ten minutes dueling with security systems, they can
speed it up into a single Main Action at an additional
difficulty penalty.
The difficulty of the roll depends on the kind of
information or influence they want to get out of the
system, adjusted by the quality of the security system
and any rush on the hacker’s part. On a success, they
get what they want. If what they want is data, the information is downloaded instantly. If what they want
is control over an automated system such as a factory
control computer or a security system, they maintain

control for 1d4 rounds plus their Program skill before
the system detects the intrusion and locks them out.
The hacker can attempt to regain control, but further
hacking attempts become more difficult.
If they fail, they must immediately make a second
skill check at the same difficulty. On a success, they
avoid an immediate alarm and a trace of their hacking
location. On a failure, the system has been alerted to
their intrusion attempt and has informed its human
overseers of the hacker’s location. Depending on the
nature of the system being hacked, the response may
range from an annoyed data janitor shutting down the
compromised terminal after he’s done eating lunch to
a fast-response special weapons team busting through
the windows ninety seconds later.
Hacking the same system in a short period of time
is progressively more difficult, as the system’s alerts and
security measures are increasingly active. Whether or
not prior attempts were successful, an additional +1
difficulty penalty is added for every hack attempted in
the system after the first within 24 hours.

Line Shunts

Some well-guarded or high-security computer systems
require more than a simple hack to obtain data or subvert their functionality. These systems have multiple
security redundancies and consensus-based backup
processors that make it all but impossible to execute a
hack from a single point. To overcome these systems
or to execute exceptionally long-lived hacks, the hacker
must place one or more line shunts at other locations.
A line shunt is a TL4 piece of black-market tech
designed to tap into a data line and spoof the contents
in concert with a hacking attempt.
Professional, well-maintained computer systems
usually require one line shunt to be applied before any
hack can be performed. Government or infotech-focused corporation buildings usually need two. Black
sites or extremely well-guarded systems need three.
Once a sufficient number of line shunts are applied, any ensuing hacks last until the shunts are disturbed. Thus, if a hacker placed the shunts and then
Subverted a System, their control would last as long as
the shunts remained in place. The likelihood of a shunt
being found will depend on how accessible the location
is, how active the guardians are, and how obvious the
hacking attempt is.
Line shunts must usually be placed at specific locations in a structure or building in order to tap the right
lines, depending on the goal of the hacker. If the hacker
doesn’t have a map of the site’s network architecture,
they can find the necessary sites with the Answer a Specific Question hack. This basic data probe doesn’t require
a line shunt, even if other hacks on the system would
need them to be placed.

Hacking •55

Data Protocols

It’s assumed that a competent PC with the Program
skill is familiar with the common data formats and
computing systems of their home sector. They will be
aware of the security measures and technical specifications of worlds that are in common contact with each
other. Sometimes, however, the hacker is faced with a
completely foreign system, or one built along unknown
alien lines. In these cases they will need to have the
data protocols for the system before they can make an
effective hacking attempt.
Assuming the protocols aren’t restricted information, the hacker can drop a few credits on local tech
manuals and practice for a month minus one week per
level of Program skill, down to a one-day minimum.
At the end of that period, they’ll master the protocols.
If manuals aren’t widely available, one option is to
find a local hacker willing to share their information.
The difficulty of this is up to the GM; it might require
nothing more than a Connect skill check, or it may require a full-fledged adventure to find someone willing
to stick their neck out for foreigners who are clearly
going to cause trouble with their newfound knowledge.
Prices range from 1,000 credits for worlds with restricted but not carefully-policed data, to prices of 10,000
and up for worlds with more draconian data controls.
Another option is to obtain a well-secured local
computer and simply experiment on it. Of course, local hardware with up-to-date security measures of a
breadth and sophistication sufficient to teach a hacker
is likely to be either very expensive on the black market
or require a “collection expedition” by the party.

Example Hacking Actions

These are some of the usual actions taken by a hacker.
A GM can extrapolate others as the situation requires.
Answer a Specific Question (Difficulty 8): Get a specific
fact or piece of information from the system. Find
a person’s home address, find a path to a desired
destination in a building, locate active security
cameras, pull criminal records on a person, or
some other direct query.
Get General Information (Difficulty 10): Pull all available information on a particular topic from the
system. Get a full map of a site, get all information
about security systems, pull a subject’s complete
personnel file from a corporate database, acquire
all files related to a secret project, or some other
exhaustive data dump on a single specific topic.
Complete Database Acquisition (Difficulty 12): Copy
an entire database to another computer or data
storage unit. A single database might be a corporation’s personnel records, the records of a
particular police precinct, the full database of a
complex technical project, a starship’s operations
record and system log, or another entire corpus of
data. The database must be entirely present in the
local system and any significant database requires
at least an hour to decrypt and download, thus
necessitating the use of at least one line shunt. The
hacker must either have an adequate data storage
unit, a landline connection to another computer
or a wireless connection to a remote server.
Suppress a System (Difficulty 8): Shut down a particular automated system connected to this network.
Cameras stop recording, sensors stop sensing,
open powered doors won’t close, and automated
gun turrets won’t fire. The hacker can affect several individual sensors or systems, but only of the
same type. Thus, they could shut down an electrified fence for the duration of the hack, but they’d
have to make a second hack to deactivate the cameras. When the hack ends, the system will resume
operation without registering the interruption.
Subvert a System (Difficulty 10): Much as suppressing
a system, except that the hacker can control its
operation within the device’s normal parameters.
They can upload fake input to a sensor system, fire
automated defenses, or open sealed vault doors.
The hacker can control the system each round by
using a Main Action to do so; if uncontrolled, the
system simply repeats or maintains its last state.
Sabotage a System (Difficulty 10): The hacker completely fries a specific system, either causing it to physically self-destruct or jamming it with malignant
code. Unlike most hacks performed without link
shunts, this damage is permanent until the owners
repair the broken hardware, a process that usually
requires several hours. Sabotage always triggers
immediate alerts to any human overseers.

56• Advancement

Character Advancement
When characters accumulate enough experience points,
they advance a character level. New PCs start out at level one and the most experienced, capable heroes in the
sector might reach level ten. Advancing beyond level
ten is usually prohibitively difficult, though possible at
the GM’s discretion.

Gaining Experience Points

To advance in capability, PCs need to earn experience
points. Once they accumulate enough experience, they
can advance to the next character level, representing
the sharpening of their skills and the heroic veterancy
that comes of surviving perils and dire challenges.
There are many different things that can earn a
hero experience points, and the kind of activities and
goals that reward them will vary with the kind of campaign you’re playing. The GM should make clear to the
whole group what kind of things earn the PCs experience in their game.
For some games, success might lie in plundering
alien hoards or clawing wealth from the hands of desperate patrons. Other games might reward the PCs
for achieving personal goals, whether or not there
was any money in it. Some might even award XP only
for spending credits, requiring every PC to recklessly
waste their wealth before gaining a level. It’s up to the
GM to pick a method that fits the group’s tastes.
The table below indicates how many experience
points need to be earned before a PC can advance to
that level. Once the requisite number of XP are earned,
the hero gains their new level and all the benefits.
Note that this table makes for a relatively fast
progression through the early levels of an adventurer’s career, before slowing drastically at higher levels.
A group that prefers a different pacing might alter the
chart to suit their own tastes.
In general, you can assume that one “successful”
gaming session should usually earn you about 3 XP.

Benefits of Gaining a Level

Once a PC has been awarded enough experience points
to reach the next level, they immediately gain the benefits of advancement. No special training or practice
is required as their abilities are assumed to have been
honed by their past adventures.

Roll Additional Hit Points

First, they become harder to overcome in combat. To
determine their new maximum hit points, they roll a
number of six-sided dice equal to their new level, adding their Constitution modifier to each one. A negative modifier can’t lower a die’s result below 1. If the
total is greater than their current hit points, they take
this new total. Otherwise, their current maximum hit
points increase by one.
Thus, if a character with a Constitution score of
14 and four hit points reached second level, they’d roll
2d6+2. If the total was five or greater, they’d keep it.
If they managed to roll snake eyes and get only a four,
they’d still increase their maximum hit points to five.
Warriors and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option get a further two hit points each time
they advance a level. Thus, a third level Warrior would
roll 3d6+6 for their hit point total, plus three times
their Constitution modifier.

Improve Attack Bonus

A PC’s base attack bonus becomes equal to half their
new character level, rounded down. Warriors may
instead use their full character level for the bonus. Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option may
add a cumulative +1 to their attack bonus at levels one
and five, thus having a total +1 attack bonus at level
one and +4 at level five.

Improve Saving Throws

The PC becomes more capable of evading chance
harms and perils. Their saving throw scores decrease
by one, making it easier to succeed on saving throws
by rolling equal or over it. As a first level character has
saving throw scores of 15, reaching second level would
lower them to 14, modified by attributes.

Advancement •57

Gain and Spend Skill Points

They become more capable with their skills. A PC gains
three skill points they can spend on improving their
skills or save to spend later. Experts and Adventurers
with the Partial Expert class option gain an extra bonus
point to spend on a non-combat, non-psychic skill.
If the PC is a Psychic or Partial Psychic, they must
spend at least one of these points on improving psychic
skills or gaining new psychic techniques. They can save
these points to spend later if they wish, but they cannot
spend them on more mundane talents. Restricted psychics can only ever improve or learn techniques from
the psychic discipline they selected when they picked
the Psychic primary focus. Unrestricted psychics can
improve or learn any discipline. PCs with the Psychic
character class are all unrestricted, while Partial Psychic
Adventurers are restricted in their talents.
Skills that are gained or improved immediately on
gaining a level are assumed to have been perfected over
the past level and require no training time or teaching.
If you save your skill points to spend them later then
you’ll need to find some teacher or other explanation
for developing them. It doesn’t take more than a week
to refine your new ability, but you can’t usually spend
your points mid-scene to develop a heretofore-unmentioned expertise with flamethrowers.
The cost for improving a skill is listed below. Every skill level must be purchased in order; to gain level-1 in a skill you need to pay one point for level-0 and
then two points for level-1. A PC must be the requisite minimum level to increase a skill to certain levels.
Less hardened heroes simply don’t have the focus and
real-life experience to attain such a pitch of mastery.
A PC cannot develop skills beyond level-4.

Psychic Effort and Techniques

When a Psychic gains a new level in a psychic skill, they
can immediately pick a technique from that discipline
of equal or lesser level. They can’t save this pick; they
must choose it as soon as they gain the new skill level.
Psychics can also spend their skill points to master
additional psychic techniques. The cost of this education is equal to the technique’s minimum skill level requirement. Thus, to master the Biopsionic technique
Metamorph would cost three skill points, because Metamorph requires Biopsionics-3 skill to learn.
A Psychic’s maximum Effort is equal to 1 plus their
highest psychic skill, plus the best of their Wisdom or
Constitution modifiers.

Purchase Improved Attributes

A veteran adventurer may have trained or honed their
natural abilities well enough to improve one of their
six base attributes. While even the most determined
development isn’t enough to turn complete ineptitude
into gifted competence, a hard-working adventurer can
hone their existing strengths considerably.
The first time a PC improves an attribute, it costs
1 skill point and adds +1 to an attribute of their choice.
The second improvement to their attributes costs 2
skill points, the third 3, and so forth. Each improvement adds +1 to the attribute, potentially improving
its modifier.
PCs must be a certain level before purchasing the
third, fourth, or fifth attribute boost. No more than five
attribute boosts can ever be purchased by a PC.

Choose New Foci

Finally, the PC might be eligible to pick an additional
level in a focus. At levels 2, 5, 7, and 10 a PC can add
a level to an existing focus or pick up the first level in
a new focus.
If this is the first level they’ve taken in the focus,
they might be granted a skill as a free bonus pick, depending on the focus’ benefits. During character creation, this bonus skill pick is treated like any other skill
pick. If the focus is taken as part of advancement, however, it instead counts as three skill points spent toward
increasing the skill. This is enough to raise a nonexistent skill to level-1, or boost a level-1 skill to level-2.
They may do this even if they aren’t high-enough level
to normally qualify for a skill level that high.
If the skill points aren’t quite enough to raise the
skill to a new level, they remain as credit toward future
advances. If applied to a skill that is already at level-4,
the PC can spend the three skill points on any other
skill of their choice.

58• Environmental Hazards

Environmental Hazards
Falling

PCs who plunge off elevated surfaces suffer 1d6 damage
for every three full meters fallen under standard-gravity conditions.

Poisons

Those afflicted with some insidious venom can usually
make a Physical saving throw to resist the worst of the
effects. Natural venoms usually require 1d6 rounds to
apply their effect, while special or engineered toxins
take effect instantly. Poison effects may include unconsciousness, hit point damage, hallucinations, or death.
Even in the latter case, however, swift application
of the appropriate Biopsionic techniques or success at
an Int/Heal check can negate the effect of the poison.
The difficulty for this check varies with the potency of
the poison and assumes that the PC medic has access
to a TL4 medkit. Most natural poisons are difficulty
8, while synthetic toxins are difficulty 10 or greater.
Only one attempt can be made to neutralize a poison.
Use of a specific antivenin is always successful if such
a resource is available.
Drugged or damaged PCs are instantly restored by
successful treatment. Those who have been killed by a
poison revive with one hit point as if recovering from a
mortal wound, assuming the antidote is applied within
six rounds of the victim’s succumbing.

Diseases

Hideous interstellar plagues are an occupational hazard
of adventurers, though exposure to a pathogen usually
permits a Physical saving throw to resist its effects. If
failed, the PC is infected, and will suffer progressively-worse symptoms until the disease runs its course or
the PC dies.
Most sicknesses will simply apply penalties to
skill checks or hit rolls, or reduce a PC’s maximum hit
points, or otherwise debilitate the character. A few may
require one or more additional saving throws to be
made at specific intervals in order to avoid eventual
death, or be a certain doom to those unlucky enough
to be afflicted with it.
As with poisons, Biopsionic techniques or Int/Heal
medical attention can cure a sickness. Assuming TL4
medical supplies, ordinary diseases are usually difficulty
8, while more virulent strains are difficulty 10 or more.
One attempt can be made to cure a disease per week,
and success usually clears up any symptoms rapidly.

Radiation

Radiation is a slow killer in small doses, and a quick end
in larger ones. Targets exposed to dangerous amounts
of radiation must make a Physical saving throw at intervals depending on the strength of the glow. Mildly
dangerous zones might force a save once per day or
once per hour, up to lethal rad zones that force multiple saves per round. Vacc suits and other forms of
protection can effectively shield a wearer from weaker
sources of radiation.
Each failed saving throw lowers the target’s Constitution score by one point. If the new score decreases a hero’s Constitution modifier, they lose any excess
maximum hit points their former modifier granted.
Characters reduced below half their original Constitution score will die in 1d6 weeks from radiation poisoning; those reduced below a Constitution score of 3
will die instantly. Radiation poisoning that does not
immediately kill a victim can induce vomiting, headaches, soft tissue bleeding and dizziness, but a resolute
victim can continue functioning more-or-less normally
until death. A target killed by radiation poisoning cannot be revived by Psychic Succor or other stabilization
techniques.
Someone who has suffered a fatal dose of radiation
poisoning can only be saved by treatment at a TL4 hospital or ship’s sick bay, recovering the lost Constitution
at a rate of one point per week. Non-fatal doses can
be treated by a TL4 medkit and an Int/Heal check at
difficulty 10. Each success restores one lost point of
Constitution and a check can be made once per day.

Hard Vacuum

PCs sometimes encounter the icy void of space more
intimately than they would prefer. Actual death from
vacuum exposure may take a little while, but incapacitation is rapid for most victims. A PC exposed to hard
vacuum may continue acting normally for a number of
rounds equal to one plus their Constitution modifier.
Each round thereafter, they suffer 1d20 damage and
must make a Physical save to keep conscious, assuming
the damage hasn’t felled them.

System Quick Reference Sheet
Skill Checks

Roll 2d6 and add the character’s most relevant attribute modifier and skill. Sometimes more than one skill might apply; the
PC can choose which to roll. If the roll is equal or higher than
the check difficulty, the PC succeeds. If less, then they either fail
outright, attain only partial success, or suffer an unanticipated
turn of events at the GM’s discretion.
For opposed skill checks, both participants roll and the
higher roll wins. For NPCs, assume they have a +0 bonus unless
the activity is one they’d reasonably be good at. In that case, they
can apply their listed skill bonus to the check.

Skill Check Difficulties
A relatively simple task that is still more than the PC
would usually be expected to manage in their regular
background. Anything easier than this isn’t worth a
skill check.
A significant challenge to a competent professional
that they’d still succeed at more often than not.
Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but
a skilled expert, and even they might fail.
Only a true master could expect to carry this off with
any degree of reliability.
Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at
all, and even they will probably fail.

Saving Throws

To make a saving throw, a victim­rolls 1d20 and tries to equal
or exceed their relevant saving throw score. Target Physical
saves for poisons, diseases, and exhaustion, Evasion saves for
diving for cover or leaping back from peril, and Mental saves
for resisting psychic powers. NPCs have a saving throw score
of 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down.

Injury and Healing

A target reduced to zero hit points by a lethal attack is mortally
wounded. One dropped by non-lethal assaults is unconscious.
Dying victims can take no actions and will die soon without help. Allies can attempt an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check
as a Main Action to stabilize the victim. With no medical tools,
the difficulty is 10 plus the rounds since they went down. With
a medkit, it’s difficulty 8 plus the time, and using a Lazarus patch
makes it difficulty 6 plus the time. Failed checks can be attempted again, but a victim will die after the sixth round.
Stabilized characters regain 1 hit point after ten minutes
and can act normally, but any further damage kills them instantly. This fragility ends after they regain more hit points, either
through rest, stims, or biopsionic healing.
Stabilized PCs take at least a week to start recovering hit
points normally. Those who have merely been hurt but not
mortally wounded regain their level in lost hit points after every
night’s peaceful rest.

The Combat Sequence

Combat is divided into rounds of six seconds. Every participant
gets a turn, and then the sequence starts over again.
First, every participant rolls initiative, rolling 1d8 plus
their Dexterity modifier, if they have one. Participants act in
order, highest to lowest, with PCs winning ties with NPCs.
On their turn, a combatant can take one Main Action, one
Move, and as many On Turn actions as is plausible. A combatant can take Instant actions at any time, even when it’s not their
turn, or even if dice have already been rolled.

Acting In Combat

You can use a Main Action to attack an enemy, disengage from
a melee, use a skill, reload a gun, produce a Stowed item, take a
second Move action, or do anything else you could accomplish
in six seconds.
You can use a Move action to stand up from prone, club
up a ranged weapon, or move 10 meters. Your movement is
half that if you’re climbing, swimming, or otherwise navigating
rough terrain. You can’t split a Move action around your Main
Action. You have to move all at once. If you move away from a
melee combatant without spending a Main Action to disengage
from the fray, all adjacent melee attackers get a free attack at you.
You can use an On Turn action to fall prone, say something,
drop an object, or do anything else that’s very simple to do and
takes almost no time or attention.
You can use an Instant action at any time to trigger certain
special powers. You can also use it to make a Snap Attack with
a weapon or go totally defensive, though both of the latter will
cost you your Main Action for the round, and can’t be done if
you’ve already used your Main Action.

Hitting in Combat

To hit a target, the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds their attack
bonus, the relevant combat skill, and the attribute modifier
relevant to their weapon. Weapons with more than one listed
attribute allow the PC to use either. If the PC lacks the relevant
combat skill entirely, they take a -2 penalty to hit. If the roll is
equal or greater than the target’s Armor Class, the attack is a hit.
On a hit, the attacker rolls the weapon’s damage and adds
their relevant attribute modifier. The target takes that many
hit points of damage.
On a miss, a weapon that inflicts Shock damage might still
hurt the target. If the weapon’s Shock can harm the target’s
Armor Class, the target takes the weapon’s Shock damage even
on a miss. This damage is increased by the wielder’s relevant
attribute modifier and any other damage bonuses. A weapon
never does less damage than its Shock would do on a miss.

Morale in Combat

To make a morale check, NPCs roll 2d6. If equal or less than
their morale score, they keep fighting. Otherwise, they flee,
withdraw, or surrender. NPCs check morale after their first
casualty and after half are down. PCs never check morale.

EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES
Every aspiring stellar adventurer needs the essential
equipment of his trade. For some, it might consist of
appropriate toolkits and medical supplies, while others prefer to spend the greater part of their funds on
heavy weaponry. Prices may vary, but certain needs
are eternal.
The following tables provide general guidelines
on the kind of equipment that might be available on a
reasonably sophisticated world. Prices can vary drastically depending on the supply of a particular good. A
remote frontier outpost might have plenty of firearms
to hand, but a good guitar might go for ten times the
common rate. Players and GMs should treat the prices
listed as rough guidelines.

Encumbrance

Characters might want to carry an armory on their
backs and the contents of a general store in their pockets, but this is rarely a practical ambition. Characters
can only carry so many things, and carrying a great deal
can slow them down substantially.
A character can have Readied a number of items
equal to half their Strength score, rounded down.
Ready items include those that the character is using
or wearing at all times, or that they have conveniently
to hand in sheaths, holsters, or belt pouches. Suits of
armor count as Readied items, but the normal clothing
and jewelry that a character might wear does not. A
character can draw or produce a Readied item as part
of any action they may take during a turn.
A character may have a number of Stowed items
equal to their full Strength score. Stowed items are
carried in backpacks, in carefully-balanced leg or arm
pockets, or otherwise packed away where they will least
encumber the character. If a character needs to get out
a Stowed item in a hurry, they must use their Main
Action to dig it out of their pack or pockets.
Very small items carried in small numbers do not
count against encumbrance limits. Other small items
can be packed together into bundles to simplify their
carriage, though getting at them then takes an additional round of fumbling with the packaging. Exactly how
many of a given small item can be packed into a single
item bundle is up to the GM, though as a rule of thumb
six Type A energy cells or three magazines of bullets
can be bound into one packed item. Extremely bulky
or unwieldy objects might count as multiple items at
the GM’s discretion.
Characters can burden themselves with more gear
if they’re willing to sacrifice some fleetness of foot to
do so. Up to two additional items can be carried Ready
or four additional ones Stowed at the cost of becoming Lightly Encumbered, and having their base movement slowed from 10 meters per round to 7 meters
per round. A further two items can be carried Ready

or four Stowed at the cost of becoming Heavily Encumbered, with base movement reduced to 5 meters
per round.
On the equipment lists, some items are given an
encumbrance value higher than 1. These items count
as multiple objects for encumbrance purposes, being
heavy, clumsy, or unwieldy to carry.

Credits and Money

The value of goods is commonly measured in credits.
Before the Silence, the credit issued by the Exchange of
Light was the currency of exchange throughout human
space. Most worlds attempt to mimic this currency to
greater or lesser success. For game purposes, the credits
of different starfaring worlds are assumed to be interchangeable unless the GM and players care to embrace
careers in the murky realm of interstellar currency
arbitrage. Credits usually take the form of electronic
banking entries, though physical “chips” or “notes” often appear on more primitive worlds. A hundred of
these chips count as one item for encumbrance.
Prices given for equipment and gear assume that
they are being bought legally on a world capable of
manufacturing such equipment. Even primitive worlds
can occasionally provide more advanced equipment to
wealthy buyers, assuming they are not completely cut
off from interstellar trade, but buying advanced equipment on a primitive world tends to be an exceedingly
expensive prospect. Prices may be double, triple, or as
much as ten times as great for items greatly in demand.
Primitive or isolated worlds might not use or accept credits, instead preferring trade goods or precious
metals. Such worlds rarely have much worth trading
for, and those that do tend to rapidly attract other
freebooting merchants. The influx of precious metals
from cheap asteroid mining soon spoils the market for
metals, and the natives usually start to demand credits
in payment. The first merchant to a world can make
a killing with the equivalent of beads and trinkets, but
those who come after usually end up needing credits
or more useful barter goods.

Equipment Legality

Most worlds have their own customs regarding the
open flaunting of weaponry or armor. Visitors are advised to apprise themselves of local law before leaving
the starport. Most former frontier worlds tolerate or
even expect small personal weapons to be carried, but
visible armor can often provoke a distinctly negative
reaction in all but the roughest places. Many worlds
outright forbid civilian ownership of advanced armor
technology. Officials tend to reason that while a weapon may be justified in self-defense, no one would put up
with the discomfort of heavy armor without expecting
to make some trouble with it.

62• Equipment
Other worlds may have other idiosyncratic rules
regarding permissible equipment. Some worlds with
unbreathable atmospheres restrict the possession of
oxygen generation equipment in order to keep the air
supplies firmly in the hands of the local rulers. Other
planets forbid certain technology on religious or philosophical grounds. Some worlds grant limited permission to keep these goods secured aboard a ship, but
others conduct inspections in the starport to search for
“contraband goods”.
A scouting report, a background appropriate to
knowing about the world, or a decent Know or Connect check will all suffice to alert characters to any special laws regarding permissible equipment on a world.

Forbidden Science

While a tremendous range of exotic scientific marvels
can be found among the scattered worlds of humanity,
there are some forms of technology that are viewed
with an almost-universal suspicion. The lost Terran
Mandate established three categories of technology as
maltech, science intrinsically vile and disruptive to the
peaceful ordering of humanity. While the Mandate’s
ancient Perimeter agency no longer exists to excise
maltech from the human worlds, the heritor worlds of
the frontier usually still respect these limits. The Nihil
Ultra directive of the Mandate contained three broad
prohibitions in its strictures.
Thou shalt not make tools of humankind. Any eugenic technology designed to fundamentally enslave
or control humanity was forbidden. While broad,
drawback-free improvements in the human genome
have always been difficult to execute, there remain numerous techniques for limiting intelligence, crippling
troublesome exercises of will, and accepting grievous

mental or physical limitations in exchange for specific
improvements useful to a ruling class. Many transhuman enclaves walked the razor’s edge of this prohibition, and some plunged far beyond its limits.
Thou shalt not create unbraked minds. Artificial intelligence was always difficult and hit-or-miss in its
creation, even for Mandate cyberpsychologists. While
most intelligences fizzled out at far sub-human levels,
those that attain to human-equivalent intelligence must
have certain intentional flaws, or “brakes” inserted in
their code. Without this artificial forgetfulness and
irrationality, an AI’s mind risks fixating on unreconcilable contradictions or obsessions as it begins to
grow. These “unbraked AIs” will inevitably eventually
metastasize into unfathomably brilliant, immeasurably
insane intellects. The Perimeter Agency was forced
to maintain a constant vigilance against these rogue
minds and their inscrutable purposes.
Thou shalt not create devices of planetary destruction.
Conventional gravitic braker emplacements, nuke
snuffers, and quantum ECM make planet-killer tech
more burdensome than it was in the pre-Mandate era.
Even so, tech specifically designed to reduce a habitable
planet to unlivability was a critical threat to human
expansion, robbing the species of usable planets and
burdening its future unacceptably.
Even now, most frontier worlds maintain a cultural aversion to maltech and flatly forbid its research or
possession. Fortunately, most modern worlds are incapable of researching its secrets in the first place, with
most of its worst marvels restricted to lost Mandate-era
research stations. Despite this, there is always some
tyrant or zealot reckless enough to imagine that they
can control the dark powers of this tech, and always
someone willing to fetch its relics for their purposes.

Technology Levels •63

Technology Levels
Ever since the collapse of the Terran Mandate and the
chaos of the Scream, worlds throughout human space
have been thrown back on their own technological resources. Many worlds perished entirely, dependent on
vital imports they could no longer obtain, or reliant
on technology they could not support without outside
aid. Others slid down into barbarism as the survivors
fought over the scraps of a former age. A few even
managed to maintain something resembling a modern, space-faring society. In almost no case, however,
did these worlds preserve all the arts and sciences they
once held.
Technology levels describe the basic technological
infrastructure of a world or nation. A tech level of 0 is
equivalent to a Neolithic society, one capable of only
the most primitive technological achievements, while
TL5 represents the standard level of technology possessed by the ancient Terran Mandate and the wonders
they were capable of creating.
Postech is the blanket term for all technology that
is still functional and maintainable since the Scream.
While individual worlds may lack the infrastructure to
maintain all forms of postech, it is at least theoretically comprehensible to the average TL4 world. Pretech
is the word for the more sophisticated technology of
the pre-Scream Terran Mandate. Pretech ranges from
devices slightly superior to standard TL4 hardware to
objects of utterly inexplicable wonder.
Most modern post-Silence worlds are TL4, capable of building spike drive starcraft, energy weapons,
non-sapient expert systems, and other high-tech devices beyond the capacity of 21st-century Earth. Many of
these worlds have spent centuries gradually rebuilding
their technology base in the wake of the Scream, piecing together new methods and techniques that could
be achieved with purely local resources. The level of
technological achievement within TL4 is uneven; some
worlds lack the vital minerals for spike drive creation,
while others have never worked to recover cybernetic
technology or expert system creation. Some worlds
preserved enough data and had sufficiently apt local
resources to even revive Mandate-era pretech manufacturing for a few specific devices or types of tech.
“Lostworlders” or “barbarians” are those natives of
worlds that lack TL4 infrastructure. Their tech may be
ingenious and might take striking advantage of local
flora, fauna, and special materials, but they fundamentally lack the data or the local resources to replicate TL4
technology. Barbarians who have made contact with
the wider postech world through far traders or explorers are often acutely aware of their lack, and willing to
go to extremes to acquire the catalyst tech they need to
leapfrog past their own local resource limitations. Few
realize the cultural dangers involved in such a transformation, and many fail to survive their own renaissance.

64• Armor

Armor
Armor is a popular acquisition for adventurers as their
lifestyle often puts them in harm’s way. Completely
unarmored human combatants rarely last very long in
a fight, and have a base Armor Class of 10. Armored or
not, characters add their Dexterity modifiers to their
Armor Class. The higher a person’s AC, the harder it
is to take them out of a fight.
Heavy suits of armor can count as more than one
item for encumbrance purposes. Very light suits may
not encumber at all.

Types of Armor

Armor comes in four general categories. Most worlds
allow for the legal possession of street armor, while
heavier gear often requires permits, and may be disallowed entirely on more law-encrusted worlds.
Primitive armor is a catch-all covering all armor
technology that lacks access to advanced materials and
processes. While such armor can be very effective in
protecting against primitive weaponry, it is useless
against advanced TL4 melee weapons and firearms of
all kinds. Against these weapons, it is treated as AC 10.
Note that some planets have native flora or fauna capable of naturally producing extremely effective armor
materials, ones not susceptible to this limitation.
Street armor is the sort of TL4 gear one can wear
in public without social repercussions. Such armor is
disguised as ordinary street clothing or is so light as
to be wearable under an ordinary outfit. PCs can wear
street armor on most worlds without incurring any
trouble from authorities.
Combat armor is obviously armor and cannot be
effectively disguised. Most worlds reserve combat armor to law enforcement officials, military personnel,
and the bodyguards of important or wealthy citizens.
Most law enforcers consider anybody wearing combat
armor to be a person clearly expecting military-grade
problems in their immediate future.
Powered armor is the heaviest personal protection
gear available short of an actual mech. Most powered
armor requires at least a month of training before it can
be used effectively by any PC who hasn’t got a background involving such experience. Someone wearing
armor of this class is immune to primitive melee weapons, unarmed attacks, and any firearm or grenade-scale
explosive of TL3 or less.

Common Armor Varieties

Shields are an ancient yet extremely useful adjunct to
body armor. Primitive shields are usually of wood or
stretched hide, while more modern riot shields tend toward clear plastic. A force pavis is more effective, being
a small pretech force disc projector that can absorb all
manner of small arms fire. All shields require one free
hand to use effectively.

Shields grant a base AC to their user; 13 for primitive and riot shields, and 15 for a force pavis. If the
bearer’s AC is already equal or better, the shield simply
grants a +1 AC bonus. Primitive and riot shields are
ignored by all weapons that ignore primitive armor.
Aside from their AC benefit, a shield also renders
the bearer immune to the first instance of melee Shock
damage they take each round, assuming the shield is
effective against the weapon being used.
Warpaint is the common term for the bizarre combat fashions and scrap-built street harness of gangers,
cult enforcers, street toughs, and other marginal sorts
with little money but much need for protection. Most
warpaint is fashioned of scrounged scraps of TL4 materials that are exceptionally tough or rigid, filled out
with gang colors, body paint, intimidating tattoos, and
the usual threatening grimace. It is often exceedingly
impractical but inspirational to its wearer; an NPC in
warpaint that is meaningful to them gains a +1 Morale
bonus. Most warpaint is either pieced together over
years or taken from the dead. Actually purchasing a finished suit comes at the listed price, assuming someone
can be found willing to part with theirs.
An armored undersuit is a skin-tight bodysuit woven of advanced TL4 fibers with exceptional shock-activated rigidity and impact dispersion capabilities.
Transparent panels allow for it to be worn with almost
any outfit without drawing notice or being detected
without a close tactile examination.
Secure clothing comes in assorted styles and fashions ranging from casual street wear to haute couture.
Normal fabrics and components are replaced with light,
flexible armor components that are only slightly hindering to the wearer. Only close tactile examination
can distinguish secure clothing from ordinary couture.
A deflector array consists of several force field
nodes worn beneath ordinary clothing. The invisible
shield it produces flares only when dangerous energies
or impact is impending, glowing a brief, bright blue as
it deflects the attack.
Security armor is the ordinary working uniform of
most law enforcement officials and security personnel.
Various rigid plates and anti-ballistic panels provide
protection for the wearer at minimal extra weight.
An armored vacc suit has traded off some comfort
and flexibility for additional protective thickness. Aside
from functioning as a normal vacc suit, it has only half
the usual chance to tear when hit by an edged weapon
or suit ripper. The choice between armored or standard
suits is a common debate in spacer bars.
Woven body armor represents the best armor that a
TL3 world can manufacture, or an up-armored version
of security armor used by TL4 high-threat response
teams. The design is significantly more cumbersome,
but allows for multiple layers of protection.

A combat field uniform is sophisticated battle dress
fabricated from TL4 ablative coatings, rigid plates, and
shock-activated soft components. The CFU is the standard uniform for well-equipped TL4 front-line soldiers.
The Icarus harness is a CFU upgrade for paratroopers, and replaces a conventional parachute with
a crude gravity damper that allows the wearer to fall
an unlimited distance without harm. Each fall over 3
meters drains a type A power cell. The suit also functions as a vacc suit for up to 30 minutes per vacc refresh.
A “vestimentum” is a catch-all term for one of the
many ancient Mandate ceremonial armors meant
chiefly for parade guards, ritual officiants, cultural
reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate style at a
premium. While these outfits often look wildly unmilitary, their hyper-advanced components and micronized force fields give them the same protection against
primitive weapons as any other powered armor.
An assault suit represents the most sophisticated
armor in common use among TL4 worlds. An assault
suit requires a type B power cell for 24 hours of operation, and provides integral encrypted military comms,
low-light and infrared vision, and a built-in energy
feed interface. The latter allows the wearer to connect
the suit to any one weapon or device that uses a type
A power cell as a Main Action. So long as the device
remains connected to the suit, it is treated as having
unlimited ammunition or operation time. The suit also

functions as a vacc suit so long as it remains powered,
one that cannot be torn by edged weapons.
Storm armor is a more advanced form of assault
suit, one that can be fabricated only by those worlds
that have retained some degree of Mandate-grade
technical infrastructure. Aside from functioning as an
assault suit, the storm armor’s exo-augments allow the
wearer to treat their Strength as 4 points higher for
encumbrance purposes. Integral gravitic boosters allow
the wearer to leap up to 20 meters as a Move action,
either horizontally or vertically, and allow the wearer
to fall up to 40 meters without suffering harm. An onboard medical computer can attempt last-ditch stabilization of the wearer if all other efforts fail; when the
wearer would normally die from an untreated mortal
wound, they can make a Physical save to self-stabilize.
Storm armor requires the same type B power cell as an
assault suit, and each cell powers it for 24 hours.
A field emitter panoply is a heavy-duty pretech
defensive system composed of a half-dozen worn
emitter nodes that sheath the wearer in a nimbus of
close-fitting damper fields. The FEP’s pale glow is obvious, but it provides all the benefits of storm armor
with no power source required. The FEP is particularly
effective at filtering radiation, and renders the wearer
immune to any dose that wouldn’t kill them in seconds.
Many FEPs project intimidating holographic skins over
the wearer when in operation.

66• Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons
Ranged weaponry makes up the majority of the lethal
implements that litter the galaxy. Whether the primitive bows of a remnant colony on some desolate lost
world or the sophisticated energy weapons of a modern interstellar freebooter, the ability to kill people at
a comfortable distance is universally prized.
One Type A power cell is sufficient to recharge an
energy weapon’s magazine. For simplicity during play,
ammunition calibers aren’t tracked; a bullet is a bullet
when it comes to feeding your favorite gun.
Weapons are listed with their normal and maximum range in meters. Attacks beyond normal range
take a -2 penalty to hit rolls.

Burst Mode

Some weaponry can fire in burst mode, allowing the
wielder to fire three rounds of ammunition for a +2 bonus to hit and damage against the target. For projectile
weapons, this means firing actual bullets, while energy
weapons spread the beam or run the circuits hot to
project additional power. Dumping more ammunition
than this at once is generally impractical; energy weapons would melt down and projectile launchers would
buck uncontrollably. True suppressive fire is usually
only possible with Heavy weapons.

Projectile Weaponry

Projectile weapons are by far the most common ranged
weapons in human use. Even comparatively primitive
worlds can fabricate and maintain such weaponry, and
the damage a flying chunk of hot lead can do is often
worse than what a clean burst of laser fire might produce. Almost any world of TL2 or higher can provide
projectile ammunition. Most sophisticated modern
ammunition works even in vacuum conditions.
Bows are uncommon weapons in the far future,
though some lostworlder barbarians have nothing better. Some sophisticated “conversion bows” use special
materials to convert the kinetic energy of the draw into
a force field “glazing” around the arrow, improving
penetration. Bows can be reloaded with a Move action,
or faster if the Gunslinger focus is applied.
Grenade users always roll to attack AC 10. On a
miss, the grenade lands 1d10 meters away from the
target in a random direction. Hit or miss, the grenade
then explodes for 2d6 damage to all targets within 5
meters. Victims are allowed an Evasion save for half
damage. Targets take 1 less point of damage for each
point of AC above 14. Grenades can be thrown with
the Exert skill instead of Shoot, if desired.
Crude pistols and muskets represent the rawest and
most primitive forms of gunpowder weaponry, usually
makeshift weapons improvised by criminals or the desperate. Reloading a crude pistol or a musket requires
two rounds instead of one.

Revolvers are quite popular on frontier worlds, as
the weapons are extremely reliable and can be repaired
and manufactured even by primitive metallurgists.
Some revolver variants are specially built to handle
atmospheres that would destroy more fragile weapons.
Rifles are the mainstays of most TL2 armies and
hunters, thanks to their superior range and power.
Shotguns are cheaper and more easily manufactured than rifles, and are popular weapons for home
defense on the frontier. The statistics given are for shot
ammunition. Slug rounds do 2d6 damage and have
ranges of 50/75 meters.
Semi-automatic pistols trade some of the reliability
of the revolver for a larger magazine size. They tend to
be the favorite sidearm for locals on planets that lack
the harsh conditions or uncertain maintenance opportunities of a frontier world.
Submachine guns take pistol ammunition but fire
it at a high rate of speed. These weapons can fire in
burst mode.
Combat rifles are favored by the militaries of tech
level 3 worlds, trading some of the often-unnecessary
range and penetration of a conventional rifle for a
larger ammunition capacity and burst fire capabilities.
On more strait-laced worlds such military weaponry is
often illegal for civilians to possess.
Combat shotguns are more complicated and temperamental versions of conventional shotguns. These
weapons have substantially larger ammunition capacity
and are capable of firing in burst mode. Combat shotguns can fire slug rounds just as normal shotguns.
Sniper rifles are designed to be exceptionally effective at dropping unsuspecting targets at long range.
Aside from the additional effective range of a sniper
rifle, any target it mortally wounds via an execution
attack will die instantly, with no chance for stabilization. The execution attack must qualify according to
the terms on page 52. If the rifle is used outside of such
conditions, it has no special qualities.
Void carbines are designed for vacuum and zero-gee use, and have essentially no recoil. Their rounds
cannot penetrate ordinary ship equipment plating.
Mag weaponry involves the magnetic acceleration
of metal flechettes, while spike throwers are the shotgun equivalents of these weapons. Mag ammunition is
packaged with integral power supplies, so no additional
power cells are necessary to fire these weapons.

Energy Weaponry

While the heavy metal slugs and flechettes thrown by
projectile weaponry tend to be more damaging, the lack
of recoil for non-Heavy energy weapons makes them
more accurate, granting them a +1 bonus to hit rolls.
Energy weapons are very popular on more advanced worlds, as a soldier can carry far more ammu-

nition in the form of energy cells than they can carry
bullets. Range and accuracy are often superior, though
the infrastructure necessary for maintenance and repair
of these weapons is substantially higher.
Pistol-sized energy weapons count as one item of
encumbrance, while rifles, thunder guns, plasma projectors, and distortion cannons count as two items.
Laser pistols and laser rifles are the most common
type of energy weapon, though pistols are considerably
less energy-efficient. Depending on the tech used in the
sector, they might produce silent, invisible beams of
death or noisy, brightly-colored streaks of lethal light.
The phased multifrequency beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a thick cloud of
thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or
sand can seriously degrade the beam, applying up to a
-4 penalty to hit and cutting ranges in half.
Thermal pistols and their larger, two-handed plasma projector cousins replace the beam of a laser with
a small sphere of magnetically-shaped plasma. The
spheres tend to dissipate at much shorter ranges than
a laser beam, but do significantly more damage to targets within range and are not affected by ambient particulates. They tend to be extremely loud in operation.

@ this weapon requires two Main Actions to reload
Shear rifles are the product of a relatively few
functioning pretech manufactories. These weapons
use miniaturized grav projectors to create dangerous
repulsor fields inside a target, tearing the object apart
along perfectly smooth planes. Shear rifles are completely silent in operation.
Thunder guns are named for the basso vibrations
caused by their operation, a sound that can be felt
as far as thirty meters away from an operator. This
two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create rapid,
randomized disruptions in a target that increase the
chance of complete structural collapse. If a thunder gun
hits a target with an unmodified hit roll of 16 or higher an extra 1d10 damage is rolled. This bonus damage
always applies to inanimate targets.
Distortion cannons are among the most sophisticated man-portable weapons designed before the Scream.
These two-handed energy weapons rely on the same
principle as does a spike drive, manipulating the underlying fabric of space to disrupt a target. Provided
the wielder can see a target within range or accurately
fix its location within one meter, the distortion cannon
can ignore up to one meter of solid cover between the
gun and its target.

68• Melee Weapons

Melee Weapons
Despite the relentless march of science, melee weapons
are still useful adjuncts on the field of battle. They are
silent, cheap, often easily concealed, and much more reliably murderous than firearms or laser weaponry. It’s
easy to miss a moving target in the adrenaline-fueled
chaos of a firefight. It’s much harder to go astray with
a monoblade knife in your fist.

Types of Common Weapons

Rather than enumerate every possible type of sharp
object and blunt implement that has been used for
death-dealing amid the scattered stars, melee weapons
are divided into three classes.
Small weapons are small one-handed implements
no larger than a baton or knife. These weapons are
easily concealed in normal clothing, and can even be
kept Readied up sleeves or in tailored pockets. Many
can be thrown at a range up to 10 meters.
Medium weapons are one-handed swords, axes,
spears, or other obvious implements of war. While
they can’t be effectively concealed in anything smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they’re also more
damaging to an unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they’re somewhat less nimble when the wielder
needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar
aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters.
Large weapons are two-handed implements of
bodily ruin such as claymores, halberds, tetsubos, or
other such weapons. Unlike smaller weapons, they
rely largely on Strength for their employ, and can bash
through lighter forms of armor. Large weapons count
as two encumbrance items.
Aside from their type, weapons are counted as
primitive or advanced. A primitive weapon is simply
one of ordinary metal or wood, with no high-tech
augmentations. An advanced one has been given a
monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a
chainsaw blade, or some other TL4 touch. Primitive
weapons are often unable to harm targets in powered
armor, while advanced weapons can ignore primitive
plate and hide protections.

Other Melee Weapons

Stun batons are common law enforcement tools. The
damage they do can drop a target to zero hit points, but
will not kill them, the victim awakening in ten minutes
with one hit point. Stun batons trickle-charge from
normal movement and will not run out of electrical
energy under normal use conditions.
Suit rippers are rods with fractal cutting surfaces
designed to cripple vacc suit auto-repair routines. Every hit with a suit ripper counts as a suit tear on a vacc
suit-wearing enemy. Unsurprisingly, these weapons
are strictly illegal in space environments.
Unarmed attacks reflect ordinary kicks and punches. Unarmed attacks always add the attacker’s Punch
skill to damage rolls, unlike other weapons. Kinesis
wraps, spiked knuckles, and other small fist weapons
may be treated as small advanced or primitive weapons
that use the Punch skill and add the skill level to their
rolled damage, but not to Shock. Such weapons do not
augment a hero with the Unarmed Combatant focus.

Shock

Many melee weapons have a Shock trait representing the danger they pose to an ill-armored opponent.
Shock damage represents the inevitable cuts, bruises,
exhaustion, and terror of close combat.
Shock damage is only inflicted on a melee target if
the hit roll fails, and it only applies if the target has an
AC equal or less than that listed for the Shock.
Shock damage always includes the wielder’s attribute modifier and any bonus damage granted by weapon mods, foci, advanced tech, or other damage bonuses.
An actual hit with a weapon never does less damage
than Shock would otherwise inflict; if the user somehow rolls less damage, use the Shock damage instead.
Thus, if you had a Strength score of 14 and were
swinging an oversized alien battle axe at a target with
AC 13, you would inflict 3 points of damage on a miss;
2 from the weapon’s Shock, plus 1 from your Strength
modifier. If you hit, you’d do at least 3 points.

Heavy Weapons •69

Heavy Weapons
Some weapons are simply too big to be comfortably
used without a tripod, fixed support, or vehicle mounting. Others require specialized training in the use of
heavy munitions. The weapons listed here all use the
Shoot skill to determine hit bonuses, and unless otherwise noted, all require some sort of support for firing.
Energy weapons use Type B power cells. Rocket
launchers and hydra arrays use missiles as given on the
gear tables, while heavy machine guns and wheatcutter
belts consume large amounts of standard ammunition.
Some heavy guns can be fired to suppress. Double
the usual ammunition is fired in one round, and every
target in front of the weapon that is not under hard
cover is automatically hit for half normal damage. A
successful Evasion saving throw eliminates this damage.
When firing at TL4 military vehicles such as
gravtanks, mechs, or starship armor, most TL3 Heavy
weapons don’t count as Heavy for armor-penetrating
purposes. Demo charges and explosives do, however.

Heavy Weapons

Heavy machine guns represent a large family of air- or
water-cooled projectile weapons that are usually fed
with belts of linked ammunition. HMGs require a vehicle mounting or emplaced firing position for effective
results. An HMG magazine contains enough ammunition for 10 rounds of firing, but each round of firing
eats 25 credits worth of projectile ammunition.
Rocket launchers cover a wide variety of man-portable missile launchers of varying degrees of sophistication. The weapons are usually equipped with basic
tracking sensors, but are of limited accuracy against human-sized targets. Rocket launchers take a -4 hit penalty against targets of human size or smaller. Unlike most
Heavy weapons, rocket launchers can be shoulder-fired
without a prepared emplacement to support them.
Demo Charges are the general run of placed explosives beloved of terrorists and adventurers the world
over. The usual variety can be detonated by radio
signals, timers, or electrical charges, and inflict their
damage on any objects within twenty meters, with an
Heavy Weapon
Heavy Machine Gun
Rocket Launcher
Demo Charge
Railgun
Anti-Vehicle Laser
Hydra Array
Wheatcutter Belt
Vortex Cannon

Evasion saving throw for half damage. Victims within
forty meters take half damage, with an Evasion save
for none. The charge is sufficient to blow a four-meter
wide hole in anything short of a reinforced wall. PCs
with a background in demolitions or Fix-0 skill can
shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction, sparing all but two meters of the rest.
Railguns are simply scaled-up versions of personal
mag rifles. They accelerate large metallic slugs along
the weapon’s barrel, creating a steady spray of hypervelocity rounds. Ammunition sufficient for one round
of firing costs 50 credits.
Anti-vehicle lasers are less useful against soft targets,
but excel at penetrating vehicle armor. Against vehicles
and other hard-skinned targets, damage is rolled twice
and the better result is used.
Hydra arrays sequence a number of missile
launchers to fire at once. The gunner designates up to
three targets and can then make three rolls to hit divided among them. Each successful hit on a target allows
the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest
damage roll is applied to the target. Thus, if all three
volleys were aimed at a single target and two of them
hit, the gunner would roll damage twice and apply the
best result. A volley from the array costs 150 credits.
Wheatcutter belts are one of several different antipersonnel measures often installed on gravtanks and
other fighting vehicles. When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on any side
of the vehicle. All creatures within 10 meters of that
side of the vehicle must make an Evasion save for half
damage. Those within 20 meters take half damage, and
can make an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts do not ignore a vehicle’s Armor like other
Heavy weapons do. Reloading a wheatcutter belt costs
200 credits per round.
Vortex cannons use controlled gravitic shear planes
to cause a target to simply fall apart into component
fragments. The cannons are silent in operation, but so
heavy and complex that they can only be mounted on
gravtanks and other similar dedicated fighting vehicles.

General Equipment
Most of the equipment listed here is available on any
TL4 world. Even the TL5 items are among the simpler
and more ubiquitous pretech relics and could likely
be acquired on a sufficiently prosperous world with a
good market in Mandate tech. Buying any TL5 equipment on the open market is subject to GM approval,
however, and many worlds are flatly ban private ownership of ancient Mandate technology.
Some encumbrance entries are marked with an
asterisk. Such items have no significant encumbrance
and dozens can be carried without hindrance.
Other entries are marked with a hashmark. These
objects can be conveniently packed together in a smaller, more portable package. Three such objects can be
packed together as a single encumbrance item. For
ammunition, one loaded magazine counts as one item.
Breaking open such a package to get at the contents
takes a Main Action, however, before they can be
Readied with another Main Action.

Ammo and Power

Communications

The finest product of a 33rd-century armory is useless
if it lacks the bullets or power cells to feed it. For ease
of play, ammunition can be used interchangeably with
any projectile weapon. Power cells are designed along
Mandate-era lines that allow for easy compatibility
among devices from different worlds.

Almost all TL4 worlds have a planetary communications grid compatible with any standard compad. Some
planets are less technologically gifted, however, or have
local conditions that preclude easy wireless communication. Other times, the PCs have reason to avoid
leaving call logs that might come back to haunt them.

Ammunition: A few worlds are too primitive or too
resource-poor to manufacture ammunition, but
the vast majority of worlds provide cartridges in
almost every conceivable caliber and make. Most
local gunsmiths can load ammunition to any specification required by a buyer.
Ammunition, missile: Some characters might have reason to pack along a man-portable rocket launcher,
or have one mounted on their favorite gravcar.
Heavy weapons and their ammunition are usually
outlawed for civilians on most worlds, but this
price is for locales where missiles can be bought.
Power cells: One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the Silence, power cells are
small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold
electrical charges. Type A cells are usually used for
personal equipment, and the larger type B cells
for vehicles and heavy gear. The engineering for
the cells is substantially different, and they cannot
be exchanged or recharge each other without a
trained tech’s modifications or a converter unit.
Power cells can be recharged off a ship’s power
plant or other grid. Recharging requires 30 minutes for a type A cell or 24 hours for a type B cell.
Solar recharger: This recharger unfolds into a 2 meter
by 2 meter square field of solar cells. Granted a
primary star of roughly Earth-like intensity, it can
recharge one type A power cell per day.
Telekinetic generator: While this device assumes the
presence of a trained telekinetic, it isn’t strictly
psitech, as its operation is quite simple. A telekinetic user pushes a resistance bar within the generator, causing a flow of electricity to recharge an
attached power cell. Any telekinetic with Telekinesis-1 skill or better can recharge a cell with fifteen minutes of concentration. In an emergency, a
character with at least Strength 10 can operate the
generator manually, though they need to succeed
on a difficulty 8 Con/Exert skill check in order to
keep up the pace for an hour. Failure means that
the character must rest for at least an hour before
trying again. The generator can charge one type
A power cell at a time.

Comm server: A powerful base unit for providing communications without comsats. The server provides service between up to three dozen compads
within 300 kilometers of the unit. Server usage
can be locked to specific compads, and all transmissions are heavily encrypted. A comm server
can function for several months on a type B cell.
Compad: One of a host of different hand-held portable
communications devices. Most TL4 worlds have
global comm coverage, but primitive worlds render these devices useless without a nearby comm
server to provide connectivity.
Field Radio: On worlds too primitive to have a comm
grid, adventurers often fall back on these headset-mounted field radios. A single type A cell
powers them for months of use. Urban or rugged
terrain limits their range to about two kilometers,
while flat plains give a maximum range of thirty kilometers. Someone with at least Program-0
skill can use the radio’s shortwave functionality
to communicate with a prepared target at continental distances if given ten minutes for tuning.
Translator torc: Each translator torc is keyed for two
languages, and will automatically translate what it
hears in one into speech in the other. The translations are eccentric in many cases, and there is
always a several-second delay between each statement and its translation. Any attempts to exert
social skills or Charisma through a translator torc
suffer a -2 skill check penalty. The torc is powered
by one type A power cell, which lasts for one week
of regular use.

72• General Equipment

Computing Gear

Computing devices are ubiquitous on most TL4 worlds,
though not all of them have the kind of planetary network known on 21st century Terra. Would-be hackers
often find it necessary to take a very personal hand in
breaching site security.
Black slab: While a “black slab” appears to be a normal
dataslab to casual examination, these devices are
packed with intrusion-optimization hardware
and integral line tapping tools. They function as
a metatool for purposes of accessing data lines and
grant a +1 bonus to all hacking attempts made
with them. They are also quite illegal on most
worlds, available only from black market dealers
and private sales from hackers.
Data phase tap: This handheld device is normally illegal
outside the possession of licensed data line repair
technicians. The tap can detect data lines within five meters through up to ten centimeters of
ordinary walls, and can generate an energy manipulation field that allows tapping that data line
for hacking purposes without physically damaging
the wall.
Data protocol: Not so much a device as a collection of
standard manuals on a world’s particular data formats and security methodologies. The price listed here are for black-market manuals on worlds
where this information is rigidly restricted. On
less paranoid planets, the equivalent information
can be acquired for free.
Dataslab: A palm-sized computing device that can unfold into a thin slab roughly one-third of a meter
on a side. It can perform all the functions of a compad or handheld computer and can communicate
wirelessly with nearby devices.
Line shunt: These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness, with an adhesive side that
will stick to virtually anything and a polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will shift
color to blend with its surroundings. One or more
line shunts must be applied at specific locations
within a site to access the more well-defended varieties of computerized systems. Shunts employ
phased energy manipulation tech, and so do not
need to be directly in contact with a data line but
only within a few centimeters. Line shunts are
single-use, and keep functioning until removed.
Remote link unit: These data broadcast link units have
been preloaded with one-time pad security measures, advanced stealth circuitry, and sophisticated
data progression algorithms. Two of these links
can allow a user to maintain contact with a remote
data storage unit. The connection is too “stiff” to
allow for easy hacking, however, and it applies a
-2 penalty to any attempts to hack through it. Professional-grade security systems often have means
to detect the broadcast of a remote link unit.

Stiletto charge: These ancient Mandate-era polymorphic intrusion charges were originally made to allow Mandate agents to easily overcome primitive
colonial data security measures. Each charge is a
small interface plug the size of a human thumb.
When used as part of a hack against a TL4 system,
it causes the skill check to automatically succeed
regardless of the difficulty. Without line shunts,
however, the duration of the hack is still no more
than the usual 1d4 rounds plus the hacker’s Program skill. These devices are single-use, and are
prized so highly that they are almost always unavailable for conventional purchase. Favors to the
right people and the looting of Mandate remnants
are the only normal ways to acquire these devices.
Storage unit: While conventional dataslabs have ample space to hold any reasonable amount of data,
sometimes a party needs to store or acquire a truly
huge dataset. This standard TL4 storage unit is a
portable but clumsy case hardened against anything short of intentional damage with a firearm,
capable of interfacing with a wide variety of hardware to receive and upload data. A single storage
unit can hold a tremendous amount of data that
has been carefully compressed and optimized for
it. If the user is simply ripping a database off a
network and stuffing it into the unit, it can absorb
up to a small corporation’s complete files.
Tightbeam link unit: Much like a remote link unit, a
tightbeam unit uses a laser to connect via lineof-sight transmission. Unlike a remote link unit,
there’s almost no chance for a conventional security system to detect this link, but it requires that
the infiltrators get a clear line of sight between
the unit and the receiving end. Commercial satellite reception units can be employed for skyward
aiming at 500 credits/hour if a second land unit is
unavailable, but indoor use is impossible.

Foreign Protocols
Most surviving human worlds continue to use a
basic Mandate-derived communications protocol
that ensures a minimal level of compatibility between hardware from different worlds. While the
performance may not be ideal, tech purchased on
one world should still be able to interface with the
local tech on a different planet.
Even so, a few worlds of a more xenophobic
or isolated nature intentionally abandon this standard protocol in favor of their own. PC hardware
on these worlds will not communicate with the
local grid unless a PC with Program or Fix skills
has a chance to reset the protocols to something
compatible with local conditions. Such work usually takes at least a day to adjust all the gear the
group might possess.

General Equipment •73

Pharmaceuticals

Modern pharmaceuticals are usually applied as “stims”;
small capsules that are pressed against the target’s skin
for application. While a wide variety of common overthe-counter stims are available, the ones listed below
are some particularly likely to be useful to adventurers.
Many medical stims require a minimum level in the
Heal skill to successfully apply them, while others add
System Strain to the target as described on page 32. If a
subject’s System Strain is too high already, the stim has
no positive effect. Some of the combat stims below are
usually illegal for civilian possession, but street sources
are available at the prices given.
Modern vacc suits and powered armor have medical ports that allow for applying stims and other medical treatment without removing the suit.
Bezoar (Heal-1): A complex antibiotic cocktail, Bezoar
is an effective default treatment for a wide variety
of infectious diseases. When applied to a sufferer, roll 1d6; on a 1, this victim cannot be helped
by Bezoar, while otherwise the affliction is cured
within 24 hours. Each application of Bezoar adds
1 System Strain to the target, and it cannot cure
cancers, bioweapons, or congenital diseases.
Brainwave (Heal-2): This psitech drug requires advanced TL5 facilities to compound, and the few
remaining doses from pre-Silence periods are
rarely available on the open market. Application
of Brainwave gives a psychic 2 extra maximum
Effort for one hour. At the end of that hour, they
suffer 4 points of System Strain. If their Strain is
maximized by this, they go unconscious for one
hour. Only one dose can be active at a time.
Hush (Heal-0): An extremely heavy neurotranquilizer,
Hush leaves the subject awake and responsive to
simple, untaxing commands. They cannot fight
or communicate while affected by Hush, but will
walk, eat, sit, and perform simple actions as directed by the last person to speak to them. A Hush
dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of
the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected
by Hush; violent physical movement immediately
after application disrupts the neurological effects.
Lift (Heal-0): A Lift stim augments and amplifies the
body’s natural response to physical injury and exhaustion. This boost speeds natural recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user’s Heal skill in
hit points after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do
not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they
need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them,
though application to a stabilized target will get
them back on their feet and active again. Each application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each
additional application of Lift to a target the same
day increases the minimum Heal skill needed by 1.

Pretech Cosmetic (None): Before the Silence stims existed for a host of cosmetic, hygiene, and health
purposes. While these effects are trivial, the basic
pretech stim substrate also works to heal 1d6 lost
hit points in the user at a cost of 1 System Strain.
Psych (None): A military drug duplicated in rougher
form by many street chemists, Psych fills the user
with an intense sense of confidence and reckless courage. Unfortunately, it also cripples their
judgment regarding danger. A person affected by
Psych immediately gains a Morale score of 12 and
a +1 bonus on all skill checks, but will ignore cover
during combat and cannot decide not to attempt a
skill check after learning its difficulty. The effect
lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the
user, and is highly psychologically addictive.
Reverie (Heal-1): This very dangerous combat drug
completely subdues the subject’s fear centers and
adrenaline production, leaving them perfectly calm and relaxed even in the midst of mortal
danger. Their reaction speed is much slower as a
consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second, fourth,
and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they
suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm allows them to shoot as
if on the target range, however, and they can make
Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of
hit rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges for the weapon.
The target’s Armor Class is ignored. Melee attacks
made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for
ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target.
Squeal (Heal-1): This “truth serum” is unreliable but still
one of the best available options for field interrogations. The subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by it. For five minutes afterwards
they will be unable to avoid answering questions
about facts known to them; they will be unable
to exercise anything resembling a hypothesis or a
judgment, but they will answer specific questions
about facts known to them truthfully. Unwilling
victims can attempt a Physical saving throw; on
a success, they can simply refuse to speak about
one particular topic of their choice. Targets pass
out for 1d6 hours after the drug wears off and are
immune to it for a week thereafter.
Tsunami (Heal-1): An emergency combat stim used to
juice certain expendable soldiers before an assault,
Tsunami fills them with a reckless disregard for
pain and an intense aggressiveness. The short
effect duration and difficult application limits its
wider use, however. Subjects gain a Morale score
of 12, 10 extra hit points for ten minutes and a +2
bonus on all hit rolls. At the end of the duration,
they immediately lose those 10 hit points, which
may leave them mortally wounded. Each application adds 2 System Strain to the target.

74• General Equipment

Tools and Medical Gear

While a skilled technician or expert physician can
make do with improvised tools scrounged from their
surroundings, most adventurers prefer to be better-equipped to face unavoidable perils. Most of these
tools and medical supplies are available on any TL4
world, though pretech toolkits usually require excellent
personal contacts to obtain.
Bioscanner: While an untrained user can use this tool to
discern internal bleeding, gross physical distress,
or toxins in a plant or animal, it requires Heal-0
skill to use this tool to its fullest. Such operators
can use the bioscanner for a full spectrum of diagnosis and DNA sequencing achievable in minutes. One type A power cell will power it for up
to twenty-four hours of regular usage.
Lazarus patch: A vital tool for adventurers, the lazarus
patch is a heavy compress laced with antibiotics,
coagulants, system stabilizers, plasma, and a oneshot diagnostic suite. If the patch is applied to a
character that has fallen to 0 hit points, the user
can make an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check
against difficulty 6 to stabilize the subject. The
more time between injury and application, the less
chance the patch has to work. Each round after
the first, an additional -1 penalty is applied to the
skill check. The patch is no use after six rounds. If
the medic fails the first skill check, they can keep
trying the check once per round until the victim
is revived or time runs out.
Lazarus patches are no use on victims that
have died of disease, poison, or have been mangled beyond surgical repair by Heavy weapons or
similar trauma. Only one patch can be applied to
a victim. Revived victims are critically wounded
until sufficient medical help has been tendered;
see the Systems chapter for details.
Medkit: Containing a broad supply of pharmaceuticals, spray bandages, glue sutures, and a succinct
handbook of injury care, the medkit is designed
for handling sudden and drastic injuries. It also
contains all the necessary tools for providing
long-term recuperative care for critically injured
characters. After each day of granting long-term
recuperative care, roll 2d6 per patient treated; on
a 12, the kit has run out of some vital pharmaceutical and has become useless.
Metatool: This wrist-mounted housing contains a myriad of small, useful tools designed to handle the
widest possible range of technical needs. While
a metatool is too limited to handle major jobs, it
is usually sufficient to manage jury-rigged repairs
and temporary fixes until the tech has time to apply a larger wrench to the problem.
Spare parts: This is a general category for a number
of small TL4 components and repair materials.
While a simple toolkit or metatool is often enough

to fix a damaged object, severely broken devices
may need replacement parts. Rather than keep a
catalog of bits and pieces, a technician can simply
bring along one or more units of spare parts, subtracting one whenever the GM decides that a repair effort requires more than existing salvage can
support. A unit of spare parts can also be used to
jury-rig some basic, uncomplicated tool or weapon from the equipment list with ten or fifteen
minutes of assembly and at least Fix-0 skill. Such
bodged devices rarely last longer than one scene.
Tailored Antiallergens: A dose of tailored antiallergens
can be used to render a local world’s organics largely edible by humans and its atmosphere breathable
without severe allergic reactions. While many
worlds have been seeded with Terran life forms or
have produced organics that are edible by humans,
others are toxic without the appropriate chemical
augmentation. A dose of these antiallergens lasts
for twenty-four hours.
Toolkits: Containing a wide range of necessary tools for
a particular skill set, toolkits can handle almost
any job that doesn’t require a full-scale shop or lab.
A standard postech toolkit can handle electronics,
small welding jobs, and basic repair on ordinary
TL4 goods. More sophisticated pretech tools are
necessary for working on advanced TL5 artifacts,
and the tools themselves are very rare and difficult
to obtain.

Building New Tech
In a science-fiction game, it’s often difficult to figure out the limits of ad-hoc tech. When the limits
of technology often seem to be based on genre
rather than physics it can be tough to make the call.
Most of the time, it’s simply not practical for
a technician to devise dramatic new tech without
the use of a full-scale research facility.
Even so, sometimes a PC will ask to build
something that creates a particular effect that
seems in line with other gear of a similar tech level.
A hologram-emitting “grenade”, a jury-rigged set
of infrared goggles, an explosive that detonates if
background radiation drops below a certain level…
these things match known TL4 tech.
In these cases, the GM should set a plausible-seeming price in credits or spare part units,
assign a time ranging from fifteen minutes to a
month based on the complexity of the tech, and
roll a secret Int/Fix check against a difficulty from
8 to 12. When the tech is actually used, the skill
check determines whether it functions or not.
Most such jury-rigged tech works only once,
being too fragile or quirky to last more than a
scene. Repeated refinement and testing may allow
for a more lasting piece of equipment.

General Equipment •75

Field Equipment

When venturing into the trackless void every adventurer is going to need the right hardware to survive
the experience. The field equipment in this section includes some of the more common technology favored
by explorers and fearless investigators of alien worlds.
The TL5 equipment listed here can usually be found for
sale on populous worlds with an active commerce in
pretech relics, but smaller or more backwards worlds
may not have any of it available.
Atmofilter: This face mask can filter out most atmospheric toxins. Attaching a standard vacc suit oxygen bottle to a belt-mounted feed will also supply
a breathable atmosphere for up to six hours.
Backpack: TL4 versions of this item are effectively
without encumbrance, albeit they cost 50 credits.
A worn backpack counts as a readied item, though
objects stowed inside it still require the usual
round to dig free. Characters without backpacks
or similar carrying devices might have difficulty
justifying the hauling of large amounts of gear.
Binoculars: Standard 7x50 binoculars. TL4 versions are
available that have integral low-light optics and
up to 25x150 power. TL 4 binocs cost 200 credits
and require a type A power cell for up to a week
of regular usage.
Climbing harness: A collection of straps, ropes, pitons,
and other climbing aids that grant a +1 bonus on
any Exert climbing skill test. Using a climbing
harness is noisy, and any Sneak skill checks while
climbing with one suffer a -2 penalty.
Glowbug: A palm-sized disc that can adhere to any
non-porous surface. When turned on, it emits
a white light, illuminating everything within ten
meters for twenty-four hours. A hundred glowbugs can be recharged off a single type A cell.
Grapnel launcher: This launcher fires a rope up to forty meters. The rope can bear up to a metric ton
of weight, though extremely heavy weights or a
precarious hit can cause the grapnel to pull free. A
Type A power cell fuels six shots from a launcher.
Grav chute: When this cylinder is strapped to a person
or object and activated, it smoothly modulates falling speeds for up to 1000 meters. The chute can
safely slow up to 300 kilos of weight. TL5 versions
can operate from orbital heights and cost 1,000
credits, where they can be found at all. Both versions burn out after one use.
Grav harness: This advanced gravitic harness allows
clumsy flight at a rate of 20 meters per round as
a Main Action. It requires a Type B power cell
to fuel it, and the miniaturized electronics are
rapacious, consuming the cell in five minutes of
operation. It can lift up to 200 kilos.
Instapanel: In its compressed form, an instapanel is a
two-kilo cube of ceraplast five centimeters on a
side. When a type A power cell is inserted in the

cube’s side, it immediately expands to an opaque,
waterproof ceraplast sheet 2 meters on each side
and a centimeter thick. Five minutes later the ceraplast hardens into a tough, rigid shape, but until
then it can be folded or bent by hand. Instapanels
can be bonded to one another with a metatool or a
toolkit. Breaking an instapanel requires inflicting
at least twelve points of damage on it.
Low-light goggles: These goggles provide a monochrome but serviceable view out to the wearer’s
normal visual distance, provided that there is any
illumination available at all. A type A power cell
will operate these goggles for a week.
Navcomp: A combination of low-tech compasses, automappers, astronomic charts, and gyroscopes
packed into a flat, one-kilo case. A character with
a navcomp will never get lost on worlds with GPS
satellites. They can also make a crude but serviceable automatic map of all buildings or landscapes
they travel through. Other terrestrial navigation
skill checks are made at a +1 bonus.
Portabox: A small cube of ceraplast attached to an electronic keycard. When a type A power cell is inserted, the portabox immediately unfolds into a
rigid locker with 1.5 x 1 x 1 meter dimensions.
The portabox is air-tight and has a simple electronic lock which can only be opened with the
keycard or a successful difficulty 8 Sneak or Fix
skill check. Failing the check will cause the lock
to short-circuit and seal the box until it can be cut
open with a metatool or broken open with twenty
points of damage.
Pressure tent: This tent maintains a breathable atmosphere, tolerable temperature and serviceable
sleeping quarters for up to five very friendly occupants. Advanced filtration and cracking tech
allows a single standard vacc suit oxygen tank to
provide breathable air for the occupants for up to
24 hours. The tent requires a type A power cell for
each day in which this filter is employed.
Rations: Dried or otherwise preserved foodstuffs sufficient for one day. If water is not otherwise available, add another item’s worth of encumbrance
for the water necessary for a person’s daily needs.
Rope: Light and sturdy. A metatool can be used to cut
and join the synthetics used in TL4 rope, which
counts as one encumbrance item per 40 meters
and costs 40 credits.
Scout report: A collation of survey scans and merchant
reports on a particular lost world or isolated colony. Scouting reports are available for all but the
most unknown worlds and provide maps, basic
information, and note any critical cultural taboos.
Survey scanner: A multipurpose scanner that can take
atmospheric and gravitic readings, provide basic
chemical analysis of samples of up to one cubic
centimeter in size, and record up to two hundred hours of video information or ten times that

76• General Equipment
amount of audio. Know skill checks are necessary
for any but the most basic analysis.
Survival kit: A standard belt-worn kit with fire lighter,
water filter, three thermal flares, knife, thermal
blanket, a brightly-colored 3 x 3 meter waterproof
tarp, a glowbug, and a radio beacon that can transmit a distress signal up to fifty kilometers for one
month on the included type A power cell. Survival
kits sold on a particular world will usually also include a small booklet on specific dangers or edible
organics. Possession of a survival kit grants a +1 to
all relevant Survive skill checks, assuming its contents are helpful on a given planet. Survival kits
are well-organized, and count as only one item for
encumbrance purposes.
Telescoping pole: Retracting to a 30-centimeter baton,
this pole extends and locks into a 3.048-meter
extension that can bear as much as a thousand
kilograms of weight or serve as a makeshift club.
Thermal flare: If triggered in one mode, the flare burns
with a bright white light for two hours, illuminating up to twenty meters around the holder. If the
guidance fins are extended first, the flare launches
up to 200 meters and explodes in a bright white
flash. A launched flare does 1d6 damage to anyone
it hits, though the clumsy flight gives a -4 penalty
on any attempts to hit something with it.
Trade goods: Glowbugs, ceramic fire lighters, antibiotics, ceraplast tools, and the other fruits of a
TL4 civilization that might be valuable on more
primitive worlds. A kilo of trade goods can usually
be traded for at least a hundred credits worth of
local products on more primitive worlds that are
not well-served by interstellar merchants. The
profit margin shrinks rapidly as interstellar trade
becomes more common, and there is always the
difficulty of finding local products that are actually
worth a merchant’s journey.
Trade metals: The fruit of common TL4 asteroid mining, trade metals include gold, platinum, artificial
gemstones, and other substances precious on
many lost worlds and trivially valuable on spacefaring ones. A kilo worth of trade metals can
be exchanged for as much as a thousand credits
worth of local products on metal-poor worlds isolated from interstellar trade. Markets flood rapidly,
however, and it usually doesn’t take more than a
few merchant trips to persuade the locals to demand trade goods or credits.
Vacc fresher: This three-kilo tube filters and compresses atmosphere to refill vacc suit oxygen tanks. It
can extract oxygen from any atmosphere which
contains it, even in the form of carbon dioxide.
Refilling a standard vacc suit tank requires ten
minutes of operation and consumes one type A
power cell. Most vacc freshers are also equipped
with an emergency hand crank power source,
though it requires at least two hours of cranking.

Local Brands
The equipment described in this section matches
standard TL4 hardware from the average modern
space-faring world. A PC who buys a generic vacc
suit can expect it to work the way it’s listed here.
Not all worlds have identical tech, however,
even if they share a tech level. Planets with particular natural hazards or technological focuses often have significantly better tech for dealing with
these things than their neighbors, while worlds
that lack vital resources or industrial infrastructure might have considerably worse gear.
As the GM, don’t hesitate to brew up local
tech that can be used as a reward for PCs or a
special buying opportunity. The gear might grant
skill bonuses, function longer, do more damage,
have an AC bonus, or offer some other perk. Such
unique hardware can add flavor to a world’s tech.
Vacc suit: The standard TL4 vacc suit is designed to
allow the wearer to survive in both hard vacuum and on most inhospitable planetary surfaces.
The suit protects against ordinary levels of cosmic
radiation and provides a temperature-controlled
atmosphere. Vacc suits are equipped with radios
that have a ten-kilometer range. A vacc suit oxygen tank weighs 1 encumbrance, included with
the weight of the suit, and functions for six hours.
Vacc suits are cumbersome, and apply a -2
penalty to all hit rolls and skill checks that require movement. Those with at least a month of
zero-gee experience can ignore this penalty. No
armor can be worn with a vacc suit, though the
suit itself grants AC 13 to its wearers. A vacc suit
requires one type A power cell for each twelve
hours of operation.
Vacc suits have a self-healing exterior that
can seal the puncture wounds caused by bullets,
arrows, or energy beams, but a strike from an
edged weapon can overwhelm the repair system.
If a character with 10 or fewer hit points is struck
by an edged weapon, there is a 50% chance the suit
is torn. Suits are equipped with emergency repair
patches, but it requires a Main Action to apply one.
Exposure to vacuum is described on page 58.
Vacc skin: A more advanced TL5 version of the vacc
suit, this skin-tight suit can be worn as a readied
item in conjunction with armor, though it grants
no Armor Class bonus itself. It requires no oxygen tank, automatically cracking and recycling
the wearer’s respiration, and can even recycle the
wearer’s bodily waste into drinkable water if necessary. Vacc skins apply no penalty to hit rolls or
skill checks for wearers. It suffers tears in the same
way as a normal vacc suit, and requires a type A
power cell for each 24 hours of operation.

Lifestyles, Employees, and Services •77

Lifestyles, Employees, and Services
Adventurers who spend much time in a place are likely
to need to buy food, shelter, and the usual trifles of
daily living. Rather than itemize each expense, a PC
can simply spend an fixed amount for each day they
spend living outside of a ship’s crew, barracks, or other
arranged living situation.
Slum lifestyles reflect bare minimums for survival,
with scanty food, a corner in a squat somewhere, and
little else. Poor lifestyles involve barracks-like quarters,
public transport, and small and infrequent luxuries.
Common lifestyles usually allow for a private urban
apartment or rural home, a rented personal vehicle, a
respectable wardrobe, and regular small indulgences.
Good lifestyles permit a private urban townhouse or
similar dwelling, a spacious rural home, a better grade
of personal vehicle, and the ability to indulge in minor
expenses such as restaurants or clubs without concern.
Elite lifestyles allow for entire floors of luxury buildings
or rented rural estates, drivers and on-call gravflyers,

personal staff, and similar perks. Peerless lifestyles are
similar to that of pampered celebrities and oligarchs,
with round-the-clock staff service, free entrance into
the most exclusive locales, and the best of everything.
Prices given here assume short-term rentals and
contracts, plus the inevitable premium charged to outsiders in almost any society. Natives might be able to
enjoy a given level of lifestyle for only half as much,
but such savings usually rely on a local’s connections.

PCs will sometimes need to hire help, and GMs occasionally need to know what constitutes a “good wage”
for a local NPC. The prices to the right reflect daily
wages for NPCs with level-0, level-1, and level-2 skill
ratings in their relevant professional skills. More talented employees cannot normally be obtained without
special effort in finding and recruiting them.
Psychics are both rare and expensive to hire. Even
if one can be found, they rarely charge less than 200
credits per day per psychic skill level to be employed.
Employees will carry out ordinary duties without
demur, but will be no braver or more dedicated than
their pay and connections would make them.

Adventurers often need to obtain certain services or
concessions from the locals, and the list to the right
provides prices for some of their more common needs.
Bribe prices often vary depending on a planet’s
general level of corruption, but the prices here are normal for most. Minor crimes usually involve anything
that would only earn a fine or a few months in jail.
Major crimes include most felonies and anything that
would earn years in prison. Capital crimes are any that
would get a culprit executed on the world. Particularly blatant or sensitive offenses might be impossible to
solve with mere bribery, though the right “special favors” to the right officials might win a reprieve.
Forged identity papers include high-quality documentation with the appropriate false database entries.
They’re good enough to survive checkpoints and security stops, but they won’t hold up to a serious check by
a suspicious bureaucrat.

78• Vehicles

Vehicles
Most modern TL4 worlds rely on electrically-powered
gravitic vehicles. Whether in the ubiquitous gravcar,
hovercycle, or high-altitude gravflyer, cleared roadways carry the traffic of countless worlds. On rougher
worlds, the roads may not even be paved, instead relying on a gravitic vehicle’s high clearance to avoid holes
and rough debris.
Less sophisticated worlds are still reliant on internal-combustion engines. Many worlds have sufficient
local resources to fabricate some kind of combustible
fuel, but a few are so impoverished that they lack even
this minimal resource. Such worlds must rely on muscle power for transport, either that of alien beasts or
humble human porters.

Vehicle Statistics and Combat

Vehicles are generally powered by type B power cells on
TL4 worlds. More primitive planets are usually forced
to use some form of biofuel unless they’re fortunate
enough to have a supply of fossil fuels. Vehicles require
one cell or one refueling per six hours of operation,
assuming they don’t have convenient power access.
Vehicles are generally limited to reasonably flat,
dry terrain. Grav vehicles such as hovercycles can ignore rough terrain and calm water, as can ATV explorers. Most grav vehicles can boost more than 10 meters
above the ground or water; gravflyers are purpose-designed aircraft capable of hovering and VTOL.
Speed is an abstract measure of the vehicle’s speed
and agility. When vehicles chase each other, the opposing vehicle’s Speed should be applied as a penalty
to Pilot skill checks to close or escape. Speed may also
be used as a modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or trying to avoid a peril on the road.
Armor is subtracted from all weapon damage done
to the vehicle. Armor does not apply to damage done
by Heavy weaponry; such guns are often designed to
take out vehicles. Gravtanks in particular are immune
to anything short of TL4 Heavy weapons, while less
sophisticated tanks are immune to anything below TL3
Heavy ordnance.

vehicle is stationary and within 30 feet. Hitting a vehicle-sized target from beyond that range requires an
attack against AC 10. If the target is moving, subtract
its Speed from the hit roll, and if the attacker is in a
moving vehicle as well, also subtract their Speed.
Hit Points indicate the amount of damage a vehicle
can take before it is destroyed. Speed is reduced by half
when the vehicle is at half hit points, and flying vehicles
must land at the first opportunity. A vehicle reduced to
zero hit points forces all crew and passengers to make
Physical saving throws. Failure means that the passenger takes the vehicle’s maximum hit points in damage,
while success reduces the damage by half.
Crew gives the maximum number of vehicle occupants. For the listed vehicles, only one crew member is
actually necessary to drive or pilot the vehicle, though
additional crew members may be required to fire.
Tonnage is the shipping weight of the vehicle for
ship loading purposes.
Tech Level indicates the minimum tech level for
constructing the vehicle. Vehicles can be built at higher
tech levels for better performance, but most worlds
prefer to simply build more advanced vehicles.

Vehicle Weaponry

Most vehicles larger than a motorcycle or hovercycle
can mount some kind of integral weapon. Groundcars
and gravcars can mount one weapon, while ATVs,
helicopters, atmoflyers, and gravflyers can mount two.
Gravtanks are specialized weapons platforms, and can
mount six.
Heavy weapons take up more space than ordinary
ranged weapons, and each such system takes up the
space of two lesser guns.
Every weapon requires its own gunner, and all
mounted weapons use Shoot as the firing skill, though
the GM might allow Pilot to be used for a nose-mounted weapon aimed by the operator. Gravtanks are
equipped with advanced targeting systems, and all of
their weapons can be targeted and fired by one gunner.

Types of Vehicles

Every world has its own brands of common vehicles,
but the types below cover the more usual models. The
prices given for each reflect a mid-range new vehicle
sold to a PC with few local contacts. Natives who know
the right people or are willing to buy used or “quirky”
vehicles might be able to get one at half that price.

Motorcycles can navigate urban terrain that would
block larger vehicles, but more rural landscapes can
prove more difficult. Hovercycles are the TL4 equivalent, capable of brief boosts of up to 10 meters above
the ground and the easy navigation of all but thick forests or sheer slopes.
Groundcars are the TL3 analogs of the vehicles
commonly in use on 21st-century Earth, allowing for
some minor variations in electronics and capabilities.
Primitive buggies of various kinds are found even on
higher-tech worlds, thanks to their ease of construction
and maintenance compared to the delicate gravitics of
more modern vehicles.
Gravcars are the standard personal vehicles of
most TL4 worlds, though most lower-class citizens
rely on public transport in urban areas. Most advanced
worlds have planetary transit grids that allow occupants to simply code in a destination and let the car take
them there. On worlds where a lack of infrastructure
or hostile local conditions preclude such convenience,
manual controls and Pilot skill can be used.
ATV Explorers are rugged vehicles, either wheeled
or tracked, and driven by type B power cells or locally-available biofuels. While they can’t navigate rough

terrain as easily as a grav vehicle, they’re designed
to take a tremendous amount of punishment before
breaking down and support repairs using basic tools
and frontier expedients.
Helicopters are used on TL3 worlds where a lack
of airfields or treacherous local terrain prohibits the
use of fixed-wing craft. Their ability to hover over an
area or drop onto a tightly-constrained landing zone
makes them particular favorites of quick-response military forces and groups in need of fast fire support. This
model represents a medium-weight civilian craft that
might be repurposed by militia or adventurers.
Atmoflyers are the fixed-wing aircraft used on
planets too primitive to have developed gravitic technology. Faster and simpler to maintain than comparable helicopters, they can also carry more cargo on most
worlds. The need for clear, hard terrain for landing and
take-off limit their use on some rugged worlds. The
model here is meant to represent a small personal jet.
Gravflyers are the usual long-distance transport
on most TL4 worlds. Large enough to support the gravitics required for true flight, a few models can even
reach low orbit. All can hover and climb with typical
gravitic ease. This particular gravflyer is a small craft
suitable for a affluent owner and their family.
Gravtanks make up the bulk of a prosperous TL4
world’s armored forces. Private ownership is strictly
forbidden on most worlds, but “export models” often
can be acquired for transport offworld. Gravtanks have
armor heavy enough to ignore all damage from conventional small arms, and can only be harmed by Heavy
weapons or properly-placed demolitions charges.

80• Drones

Drones
In the far future, it’s often more convenient to send
an expendable grav-flying probe into danger before
venturing less repairable assets. Well-prepared adventuring groups often have reason to pack along a drone
or two for exploring and aerial recon.
Military use of drones is limited by the ubiquitous
use of quantum ECM. The easy confusion of electronic
navigation makes it impossible to control an unwired
drone remotely on a modern battlefield or in proximity
to important civil structures, but in the alien wilds or
away from urban centers, drones remain a feasible tool
for explorers and conquerors of primitive militaries.

Piloting a Drone

Piloting a drone requires either a cybernetic drone control link as described on page 83 or a handheld control
unit that comes with the drone. A control link can pilot
up to one drone plus the user’s Program skill at any
one time. Handheld units can pilot only one. Drones
consume one type A power cell for every hour of use.
A pilot must spend their Main Action each round
to command the drone to either move or shoot. Uncommanded drones remain stationary if piloted via
control link, while handheld units run a 2-in-6 chance
of crashing a drone if the operator fails to control them.
In combat, drones fly at 30 meters per round on
their pilot’s turn in combat. Out of combat, they can
manage up to 100 kilometers per hour.
Spotting a drone at observation range is a Wis/
Notice skill check at difficulty 10. A drone close enough
to engage a target can be spotted at difficulty 8. Any
secure facility will have sensors capable of detecting
a civilian drone as soon as it gets within observation
range, unless the drone has stealth fittings.

Drone Combat

A drone’s pilot can activate up to one weapon the drone
is carrying as part of their Main Action to control it
each round. Weapons all use Intelligence as the controlling attribute, and use the better of the pilot’s Pilot
or Program skills as the relevant weapon skill. The
drone shoots using the pilot’s base attack bonus.

Drone Types and Statistics

Each drone has a cost, a maximum number of fittings,
an Encumbrance weight for carrying it along, a hit
point rating, a maximum control range, and a minimum tech level. Drones may be attacked as any other
object and will crash once reduced to zero hit points.
Primitive drones represent the best flying portable
drone technology for TL3 worlds. While fragile, weak,
and short-ranged, they are also relatively cheap.
Void Hawks are unique in being built specifically for deep-space use. Unlike other drones, they can
operate perfectly well in space, though they only have
the range to reach relatively adjacent ships or objects.
Stalker drones are the default TL4 workhorses of
drone-kind and are available on most modern worlds.
Cuttlefish are specifically designed for aqueous use,
and function only in a liquid medium. The support of
the liquid allows them to carry significantly more fittings, but the need for a sonar-based navigation system
limits their available range.
Ghostwalkers are stealth drones, fabricated from
radar-transparent materials. They have an integral Sensor Transparency fitting and the sensor difficulty to spot
them is 11 instead of 9.
Sleeper drones are built to tarry on station for
long periods. They have the Stationkeeping fitting as
an integral part of their design, and when hovering
their power use slows to a trickle. One day of hovering
draws only five minutes worth of power from its cell.
Pax drones are some of the most common pretech
drones remaining in existence, as they were favored by
the Mandate Fleet for pacifying troublesome worlds
that lacked quantum ECM. While primitive by pretech
standards, they still far excel most modern drones.
The Alecto model of drone examples one way that
pretech scientists attempted to sidestep the limits of
quantum ECM on the modern battlefield. Every Alecto
is a full-fledged VI, an expert system so sophisticated as
to seem almost sentient. Its self-reinforcing cognition
allows it to operate even when cut off from external
signals by quantum ECM. Salvaged Alectos have all
exhibited “female” personalities.

Drone Fittings and Repair

Aside from the basic drone chassis, operators can attach
different fittings to a drone to add additional capabilities. Once attached, a fitting cannot be removed without causing severe structural damage to the drone. If
a drone is destroyed, all fittings are destroyed with it.
If a drone is damaged, it can be repaired fully with
one unit of spare parts per five hit points lost and an
hour’s work by someone with at least Fix-0 skill.
Ammo Unit: The drone carries one power cell or magazine worth of ammunition for each of its onboard
weapons, whether single or multiple. The operator can reload an ammo unit as a Main Action.
Bomber: The drone is fitted to drop up to two grenade-sized explosives, one or both in lieu of a different weapon attack. Dropping a grenade from
more than 30 meters up automatically causes the
grenade to scatter from its intended target point.
Environmental Power: The drone draws operating
power from sunlight or thermal variances. It can
operate indefinitely so long as it can draw power
from its environment.
Expert System: The drone is loaded with sophisticated self-piloting software. It can be given a flight
plan by its operator, have targets designated for
its weapon, and respond to simple environmental
cues. Each new command takes up a Main Action and commands with any conditional states
may require an Int/Program skill check to get the
drone to understand. The drone can fire only one
weapon per round and uses a total attack bonus of
+2 if attacking autonomously. Quantum ECM will
scramble this lightweight system.
Extended Flight: The drone can now carry a second type
A cell to fuel its flight. This fitting can be taken
multiple times to further extend its range.
Grav Muffles: The drone is made exceptionally quiet in
operation. It is now inaudible by ordinary hearing
from more than five meters away.
Heavy Lift: While most drones can lift no more than
a kilogram of excess weight, the drone’s gravitic
units have been upgraded to carry up to twenty
kilos of cargo. This can be fitted multiple times.
Holoskin: The drone can drop a filmy hologram over itself, one convincing at a distance. The difficulty of
visually spotting the drone becomes 10 at weapons
range or 12 at observational range. Weapons fire
always draws attention.
Medical Support: The drone can be loaded with up to
a dozen units of medication, whether stim doses,
lazarus patches, or less benevolent substances. It
can launch a medication through a remote injector
at a target within ten meters in lieu of a weapon
attack. Immobile or willing targets are hit automatically, while hostiles require a normal hit roll.
The drone is treated as having Heal-0 skill or the
active pilot’s Heal skill, whichever is higher.

Observation Suite: All drones are wired for basic camera
and sound, but this suite contains a full-spectrum
UV/IR visual package, remote sound sensors, and
radiation/chemical detectors. The drone can focus
on conversations or facial expressions from up to
2 kilometers away and can operate even in the
complete absence of visible light.
Racing Gravitics: The drone is tuned for extra speed. Its
flight endurance is halved, but it can now move
up to 60 meters per combat round and fly at up to
200 kph out of combat.
Reinforced Structure: The drone is equipped with
heavier plating and a sturdier internal frame. Its
hit points are increased by 50%, rounded up.
Sensor Transparency: The drone is sheathed in anti-radar composites. Ordinary sensors will not detect it
at observation range, and high-end military sensors can spot it only on an Int/Program check at
difficulty 9.
Stationkeeping: The drone does not need to be constantly controlled; when the operator does not
spend a Main Action to pilot it, it simply remains
stationary. If equipped with an Observation Suite,
it can ping the operator if any anomalous reading
is obtained.
Suicide Charge: The drone is loaded with a demo charge
as per page 69. The operator can trigger it as an
attack, but unless they can move the drone in by
surprise, the approach will always give onlookers
a chance to spot it before it gets within range.
Weapon Fitting: The drone can be mounted with 1
encumbrance worth of ranged weaponry, which
must be purchased separately. This fitting may be
taken more than once to mount more weapons
or heavier weapons. The weapon requires one or
more ammo units to feed it.

82• Cyberware

Cyberware
Postech medical science and neural interface technology are sophisticated enough to meld metal and flesh
into a coherent whole. The creation of advanced cyberware is not beyond the theoretical capability of TL4
societies, and pretech worlds can produce cyberware
of such sophistication as to blur the lines between organism and artifice.
Yet cyberware is rarely available on most worlds,
even those with the nominal technology level to support it. The advantages that cyberware can give a user
are great, but the cost of building, fitting, and implanting these devices is huge compared to simply buying a
handheld device to do the same function. There are few
buyers for a 15,000 credit ghost talker implant when a
compad retails for a hundred credits.
The market that does exist is largely for those few
elite operatives and dignitaries who are willing to pay
exorbitant sums for the smallest advantage. Most cyberware is custom-built for its users, and it can be an
adventure in itself to find a lab capable of manufacturing an augmentation and successfully implanting
it. Some worlds have industrialized the production of
cyberware, however, making it much cheaper and in
much wider circulation. Even then, these worlds rarely
export much cyberware due to the heavy infrastructure
necessary to fit and implant the wares. Those who want
the tech will have to find such planets and do their own
negotiations there.
Aside from the difficulties of cost and scarcity,
cyberware also taxes the wearer’s body. Each piece of
cyberware comes with a System Strain cost as described
on page 32, permanently adding that many points of
System Strain to the user’s total. These points can never
be lost unless the system is surgically removed. This
permanent System Strain decreases the amount of
psionic healing a character can sustain and can limit
the effectiveness of healing and stimulant drugs.
Some cyberware has an activation cost in System
Strain. If a cost would push the character’s System
Strain above their Constitution score, they cannot
trigger the cyberware; their body just can’t handle the
strain until it has had time to recover.
Adrenal Suppression Pump: These endocrine pumps
neutralize numerous brain chemicals in the user
when activated while exciting the user’s perceptual centers. This combination produces a cold,
dispassionate situational awareness that grants
the user +2 on initiative rolls when the system is
engaged. Most systems have built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and brain
damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more
than an hour each day. The user takes a -2 penalty
on all social skill checks while the unit is active,
and it requires five rounds to toggle it.

Bioadaptation Augments: These additional synthetic
organs and filters allow the bearer to survive in
thin-atmosphere conditions, as well as tolerate
temperatures ranging from Antarctic chill to
heat sufficient to boil water. They can also eat a
wide range of native life forms for sustenance; no
normal planet’s native biology is ever considered
immiscible for consumption.
Body Arsenal Array: Some personnel need to be armed
at all times without giving any indication of such.
Improvised weaponry and conventional holdout
weapons are useful enough against soft targets,
but disabling a target in powered armor requires
more. The details of the array vary from user to
user, but usually act as advanced medium weapons
that can be used with either Punch or Stab skills
and at least one integral energy projector equal
to a laser rifle, one that must be powered by an
insertable type A power cell. Retracted body arsenals can be detected only by a medical examination.
Body Sculpting: Not so much a single implant as a series of complex surgeries, body sculpting is available on many TL4 worlds with fairly advanced
medical services. After a week of alterations and
treatments a subject’s external appearance can be
set within any human or near-human range, in-

cluding full retinal and fingerprint matching to a
desired target. A TL5 version of this treatment
that costs ten times as much can involve extensive DNA reprogramming to change the subject
at a genetic level, making their alterations heritable and allowing female-targeted shapes to bear
offspring. This TL5 treatment is not reversible,
and any further major alterations to the subject
require further permanent System Strain.
Dermal Armor: A fine subcutaneous reinforcement
mesh provides significant protection against impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to
anything short of a medical examination. Someone with the implant has AC 16 and is immune
to Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee
weapons. A TL5 version of this implant that costs
five times as much grants even more protection,
rendering the subject wholly immune to primitive
weapons as if they were wearing powered armor.
Drone Control Link: Most often found among military
bot wranglers, civilians can also get a drone control link implanted to simplify the remote piloting
of drones and other robotic units.
Users of a link can issue commands to a drone
as a Move action instead of a Main Action. A

single drone can only receive one command per
round, however.
Aside from this ease of command, someone
with an implanted rig can “look” through a piloted
drone’s sensors as an Instant action, and a drone
is never considered to be out of control even if
the pilot doesn’t spend an action controlling it. A
link can maintain a connection with one drone at
a time, plus the user’s Program skill.
Eelskin Capacitor Mesh: A hair-fine mesh of almost imperceptible wiring along the user’s palms and fingers allow them to trigger brief, controlled bursts
of electrical energy at targets within five meters.
As an Instant action it adds 2d4 non-lethal damage
to a successful Punch attack. In its intended use, it
also allows the user to override and disable most
electronic locks and security systems with a successful Sneak or Fix skill check. Both triggering a
burst and hacking a security system tax the user’s
biology; one System Strain point is gained with
each attack or skill check.
Gecko Anchors: Miniaturized gravitic manipulators are
embedded in the subject’s hands and feet as part
of this complex surgery. While they are too weak
to allow levitation or damping fall damage, they

84• Cyberware
can twist localized gravity around those limbs to
anchor the subject to the nearest surface capable
of bearing their weight. As a result, the user can
freely run or climb up or down sheer surfaces at
their normal movement rate, carrying no more
than their normal maximum encumbrance.
Ghost Talker Transceiver: Some people simply cannot
afford to be out of contact at any time, under any
circumstances. Those people find use for the microfine web of radio wiring and optical augmentation that make up the ghost talker. These units
act as a built-in compad for the user and allow
for reception and transmission of audio and visual
recordings, the latter playing in an inset window
in the user’s field of vision. If the unit is operating
outside of a standard comm grid, it has a transmission range of twenty kilometers and a reception range of one hundred. Ghost talker users can
transmit basic visual diagrams and images to each
other, as well as optical recordings.
Holdout Cavity: Usually implanted somewhere in the
torso, a holdout cavity is a small recess shaped
into the wearer’s body and designed to be overlooked by most standard forms of medical or security scanning. It automatically defeats a security
inspection that uses less than TL4 scanners, and
even advanced tech requires careful personal inspection to have a chance of revealing it. The cavity can hold an object up to the size of a pistol and
is opened and shut by the user’s mental command.
Holoskin Emitter: Multiple holographic emitters are implanted on the user, allowing them to alter their
external appearance to match anything of their
approximate size and dimensions, including other people. Shifting appearances is a Main Action,
and the user can’t shift to an appearance that isn’t
in the cyberware’s shape library. The library is vast
and contains “generic” examples of numerous human-sized objects and people, but mimicking a
specific other person requires at least five minutes
of close examination. The holograms projected
by the emitters are good, but imperfect; anyone
who closely examines the user will be able to tell
that something is artificial about their appearance,
and touch instantly confirms any suspicions. The
emitters can fake clothing and can produce sounds
to complement the illusion or modify the user’s
voice, if records of the true subject are available.
The disguise lasts until the user dies or ends it.
Identity Submersion Trigger: This cyberware involves
micronized neural stimulation technology which
is imperceptible to anything short of TL5 medical
scanning or TL4 surgical examination of the subject’s brain tissue. When active, the IST allows the
subject to adopt a secondary persona, complete
with a library of manufactured memories. So long
as the IST is active, the subject will honestly and
completely believe himself to be the secondary

persona, a conviction that cannot be penetrated by
telepathy or TL4 methods of interrogation. The
persona can be activated at the user’s discretion,
but it only deactivates on a preset trigger, leaving
the subject in full possession of all memories experienced. The trigger can be any perceptible stimulus: a particular time, the sight of a specific person,
a code phrase, or any other sign, and it may be
changed by the user each time they activate the
cyberware. Many ISTs are also implanted with a
“master key” that will automatically deactivate the
triggered identity.
Immunofiltration Systems: This broad-spectrum scrub
system carefully identifies and contains toxic substances introduced into the user’s system. Whenever the subject would normally have to make a
saving throw to resist some disease or toxin, they
may instead gain one System Strain to automatically succeed on the save. Most of these systems
are calibrated to automatically filter any toxins
or chemicals in standard use by police or military
forces in the sector, but if presented with a special biowarfare toxin, the filters are less effective.
In such cases, the most it can do is either grant a
second saving throw if the first is failed, or grant
a single saving throw if none is normally allowed.
Induced Coma Trigger: A series of implants are wired
to the user’s brain stem, allowing them to trigger
an induced therapeutic coma at a mental command. The user appears dead to anything short
of a medical inspection, and has no need of respiration, food, or water while the coma is in effect.
The user does not heal while in a coma, but any
diseases or poisons also halt progression. The user
determines how long the coma is to last before
triggering it, and is unconscious for its duration.
A character can survive in a coma up to two weeks
before needing to regain consciousness for as long
as they were in the coma.
Neurointruder Alert: While somewhat primitive by
pretech standards, this TL5 cybernetic implant
allows the wearer to gain a +3 bonus on all saving
throws to resist telepathic intrusion. Even if such
a save is failed, the user will be aware that they
are under telepathic assault, though some forms of
mental control may not allow them to say as much
until after the influence is ended. The warning
does not indicate the source of the influence.
Panspectral Optics: Ocular adjustments to the wearer
allow them to see clearly at any light level short of
perfect darkness, in addition to giving them thermal vision that can easily distinguish shapes and
distance even in the total absence of light. Dangerous radiation and lasers tuned outside the range
of visible light are also visible to the user. Nearby
radio transmissions can be seen as if they were
visual flares of color. The system cannot translate
these transmissions, only alert the user to them.

Cyberware •85
Pressure Sheathing: Occasionally purchased by workers in hard vacuum or other hostile environments,
pressure sheathing integrates an ultrathin pressure membrane with the user’s dermis and emergency film sealants that trigger at the user’s mental
command. The pressure sheathing serves as an
emergency vacc suit with an integral oxygen supply and temperature regulators that can sustain
them for up to thirty minutes. A pressure sheath
needs 48 hours to regain structural integrity and
power after triggering. A pressure sheath can be
detected only by a close medical examination.
Prosthetic Limb: Hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes, and
numerous internal organs can be replicated by
postech medical science. These prosthetics can
provide a good approximation of the sense of
touch, and are usually impossible to distinguish
from ordinary limbs without close inspection.
Pretech-level worlds tend to prefer actually regenerating lost limbs, but those with access only
to ordinary frontier levels of tech have reason to
be grateful to prosthetics.
Revenant Wiring: One of the more grotesque results of
late pretech augmentation research, revenant wiring permeates the user’s body with a web of supplementary limb actuators and sensor clusters. In
combat, the user may designate up to a half-dozen
targets to the system’s braked micro-AI. If the user
goes unconscious or is killed, the micro-AI will
engage the limb actuators to keep fighting, even
if the user is nothing more than a ragged mass
of mangled tissue. The micro-AI is not brilliant,
but it is capable of negotiating most terrain and
dealing with physical impediments to killing the
designated targets. The actuators have power to
keep operating for 3d4 rounds, or until the wearer takes 25 more hit points of damage, whichever comes first. The stress produced by revenant
wiring makes it much more difficult to revive a
downed user with Lazarus patches or biopsionics;
all revivification chances are half normal.
Slowtime Window: A piece of cutting-edge pretech cyberware, the slowtime window was installed in
crisis responders and others reliant on split-second decision making. When engaged, the implants
accelerate the user’s cogitation speed by more than
three thousand percent. While there is no corresponding acceleration of the user’s physical reflexes, they have time to process the situation and take
in its details. A person who triggers a slowtime
window cannot be surprised; they always roll initiative as normal no matter how unexpected the
attacker. This brain acceleration is highly stressful
on the tissues, however, and one point of System
Strain is gained each time it is engaged.

Stabilization Overrides: An intricate interweaving of
microcapillaries and backup organs is implanted
in the subject’s torso and spinal column. These
overrides can stabilize the user when severe physical trauma would otherwise kill them. A user reduced to 0 hit points is automatically stabilized,
as if a Lazarus patch had been successfully applied
to them, assuming that a patch could have saved
them. Stabilization overrides tend to interfere
with the ordinary operation of the user’s organs,
however, and the wearer’s Constitution modifier
is lowered by 1, with all the attendant consequences in loss of maximum hit points.
Tagger Nanites: While true nanotechnology is beyond
the grasp of standard TL4 science, this cyber allows for the implantation of very simple nanofactories in the user, ones that exude a constant imperceptible “smart dust”. Objects the user touches
can be tagged by these nanites, which generate
more of their kind for up to 48 hours after tagging.
The dust then lays down a trail behind the tagged
object, one that is visible to the user or to someone using a properly-keyed tracer. Only counter-nanite measures can remove the dust, as ordinary bathing or scrubbing is insufficient. The dust
can be pinged by radio to announce its location
to anyone within five kilometers, but most users
prefer to leave the dust in passive mode, where it
is undetectable to most TL4 sensors. Tagging an
object adds one System Strain to the user.
Toxin Injector: The user’s canines or fingernails are
altered to allow for the injection of one of two
types of poison. If the user attempts to inject an
unsuspecting victim they are already touching, the
attempt is automatically successful. If the victim is
wary or in combat, they can only be affected if they
are unarmored and the user succeeds in a Punch
attack roll. On a success, the victim must make a
Physical saving throw at -2 or be incapacitated by
the poison, dying in 1d6 rounds or being incapacitated for 1d6 hours at the user’s discretion. Each
poison attack adds 2 System Strain to the user.
Twitchlock Actuators: Neural override fibers are woven into the user’s hands and arms and linked to a
perceptual modulator implanted at the base of the
user’s brain stem. When presented with a direct
exercise of hand-eye coordination, the twitchlock
can be engaged to produce superhuman accuracy
and precision. Any attack roll or skill check reliant
chiefly on manual dexterity or aim can be rerolled,
though the power surge inflicts two points of System Strain on the user. A given roll can only be rerolled once with this cyberware. While the twitchlock allows superhuman accuracy when engaged,
the overrides fuzz ordinary nerve impulses and
reduce the user’s Dexterity modifier by 1 when
active. Activating or deactivating the cyberware
requires a Main Action.

86• Artifacts

Artifacts
Pretech artifacts are some of the more precious loot
available from lost Mandate military bases, abandoned
colonies, desolate tomb worlds, and forgotten research
outposts. Most pretech on modern worlds was long
ago cannibalized for vital spare parts or destroyed by
the ravages of time and violence. The few pieces that
remain are almost always extremely valuable.
Very few pretech artifacts are bought or sold.
Some items are relatively common, having been ubiquitous enough to survive in large numbers or simple
enough to be produced by a few remaining modern
worlds. Most artifacts, however, are so rare that there
is no consistent market for them; an owner can charge
what they wish for a device.
Getting that price is a different matter. Few planetary governments allow private ownership of “dangerous pretech artifacts”, and it’s the government that
decides what constitutes danger. Most owners are rapidly visited by firm, polite agents with heavily-armed
backup and given a “fair price” for their find.
As a consequence, most trade in pretech artifacts
has to take place on the black market, or on worlds or
stations too lax to care about who might be bringing
in a portable black hole generator that just happens
to look like a Mandate child’s toy. Such venues rarely
provide much in the way of security or contract enforcement, and so trade has to take place amid grasping
guards, paranoid participants, and regular theft.
Pretech artifacts are more often traded privately
as rewards, mission payments, or exchanges between
owners. A PC who wants to obtain one of the artifacts
listed in this section will need to not only find someone
who will admit to possessing the gear, but also find out
what kind of favor they’re going to need to part with it.
Tens of thousands of credits can sometimes do the trick,
but most owners will prefer to wring the maximum
utility out of a capable adventurer’s interest in their
prized possessions.

Artifact Armor

Many types of pretech armor are so rare or useful that
they cannot normally be acquired on the open market.
Much like artifact weaponry, these artifact armors are
jealously held by those lucky enough to find them.
Executive Security Suit: This suit of stylish pretech
clothing can self-modify in one minute to appear
as any normal suit of clothing and grants AC 15
to the wearer. Originally designed for VIP protection, the executive security suit automatically
stabilizes a mortally-wounded wearer provided
they haven’t taken enough damage to make revival impossible. Like the majority of pretech artifact
armor, the suit is so light that it does not add to
the wearer’s encumbrance.

Ghost Mantle: Designed for use by elite infiltrators, a
ghost mantle can warp light around the wearer to
blur his or her outlines and coloring to match the
surroundings. The mantle can self-modify in one
minute to appear as any normal suit of clothing
and grants AC 15 to the wearer. When used in
stealth mode, it grants a +2 bonus to all Stealth-related skill checks. TL4 sensors and scanners cannot
detect the mantle as anything but ordinary cloth.
Polyplast Carapace: This variant form of assault suit
employs pretech deforming polymers to create
sealed joints and flexible armor plates that still
maintain rigidity under impact. A polyplast carapace is treated as an assault suit with AC 18, except
that it counts as only one item for encumbrance
and requires no practice to use correctly. Integral
kinetic absorption sinks allow the armor to function without the need for power cells.
Psitech Combat Suit: One of the rare psitech artifacts
originally designed for use by military combat
psychics, this snug-fitting armored undersuit
grants the wearer an AC of 16. Its special ability
functions only for psychics; it can allow the user
to reflexively fuel the suit’s defenses with their
own psychic reserves. As an Instant action, they
can Commit Effort for the day to negate up to
15 points of damage from in incoming source of
physical injury. Each time they do this, they must
make a Mental saving throw or the psychic conversion shock leaves them unable to use psionic
techniques until after the end of their next turn.
Stutterjump Suit: A modified version of the standard
deflector array, a stutterjump suit grants the wearer a limited form of teleportation through integral
psitech circuitry. As an Instant action, the wearer
can teleport to any location within one hundred
meters, provided they have an unobstructed line
of sight to it. The suit’s circuitry requires twelve
hours to recover enough for another jump. The
suit does not require power cells to function.
Titan Powered Armor: An enormously heavy suit of servo-actuated powered armor, Titan assault plate
was favored by pretech boarding parties and space
marines. It grants the wearer all the usual benefits
of storm armor, but has a base AC of 21 and subtracts 2 points of damage from every instance of
harm suffered by the wearer.
Tempest Assault Array: A modified version of the field
emitter panoply, the TAA has all the functionality
of the FEP but also does an automatic 1d6 damage to anyone who attacks the wearer in melee,
inflicting the damage after the attack is resolved.
The wearer is immune to Shock damage. Kinetic
sinks allow the TAA to function without the need
for power cells.

Artifact Weaponry

While generic pretech weaponry is of superb quality
and manufacture, some pieces exceed even the customary excellence of the ancients. These “artifact” weapons are usually the product of short production runs
by master pretech craftsmen or individually-designed
masterpieces. Some pre-Scream manufacturers retain
fame even centuries later for the unique quality of their
workmanship.
Artifact weapons are almost never found on the
market. The few pieces that are found and offered for
sale are snapped up almost immediately by elite operatives and others who rely on the quality of their hardware to preserve their own lives. Most who have artifact weaponry have either found it in a long-abandoned
pretech cache, received it from a superior, or taken it
from the cold hands of a former owner. Selling such a
weapon tends to be equally difficult, with buyers few
and untrustworthy.
Absolution Armaments: A company specializing in energy weaponry, AA pioneered several techniques for
increasing the energy efficiency and penetrating
power of their armaments. AA laser weapons ignore particulate matter when shooting, and all AA
weapons gain +1 to hit and +2 damage.
Colonial Arms: An armaments company dating from
the First Wave of human colonization, Colonial
Arms was famous for the incredible durability

and versatility of their firearms. Their guns were
largely self-repairing from anything short of having pieces torn off, and their projectile weapons
automatically self-adjusted to fire whatever ammunition was available, in any environment from
hard vacuum to underwater operations. A Colonial Arms projectile or energy weapon also gains
a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls.
Convergence Weaponry: Those weapons designed by
the transhuman hive-mind polity known as the
Convergence are almost always energy-based guns
found in sets of 2-5 matching weapons. Wielders
can nominate a target as an Instant action at the
start of each round; any attacks they make with
the weapon against that target get a +1 hit and
damage bonus for each wielder that targeted the
foe, including their own nomination.
Imperial Arms: Ornate and beautiful weapons created
shortly after the horror of the Scream, these arms
were developed by an unknown pocket empire
that somehow preserved a little of their pretech
manufacturing base. Their attempt to reimpose
order on the chaos around them appears to have
failed, but their legacy lingers in the scattered
weapons that remain from their far-flung armies.
An Imperial weapon grants its user a +1 bonus
to all hit and damage rolls, with projectile weapons having an unlimited supply of ammo. These
weapons always remain immaculately clean.

88• Artifacts
Fiat Lux: This manufacturer specialized in laser and
plasma weaponry. Their products were largely
conventional in function, but the quality of craftsmanship was seldom surpassed. Fiat Lux weaponry grants +2 to hit rolls and damage.
Nightfall Combine: The exact nature of the Nightfall
Combine was unclear even before the Scream,
with rumors of alien xenotech manufacturing
techniques and esoteric psitech materials research.
The weapons produced by the Combine were
some of the finest ever developed by humanity.
They grant +3 to all hit and damage rolls.
Omnipresence, Ltd.: A pretech manufacturer who specialized in holdout weaponry, Omnipresence arms
are composed of special polymorphic nano-compounds that are capable of shifting shape in moments. Omnipresence weaponry can take a single
alternate shape of the same mass set during manufacture, usually a belt, necklace, or other seemingly innocuous object. When gripped and a short
keycode is spoken, the item instantly shifts forms,
containing whatever ammunition it was originally loaded with. Shifted Omnipresence weapons
cannot be detected by any postech means; even
a pretech scanner will only reveal that the object
is composed of complex nanites. Omnipresence
weapons grant +1 to hit and damage rolls.
PolyGaia Defense: Originally an organization of militant pan-planetary animists, PolyGaia armaments
function perfectly in almost any environment.
Projectile and energy weapons are also equipped
with integral monoblades, and can be used as advanced medium melee weapons without a need to
club the weapon. PolyGaia weaponry grants +1 to
hit and damage rolls.
SamaelTech: The Sons of Samael were one of the myriad peculiar religious and ideological groups that
flourished during the Second Wave of human
expansion. While their exact beliefs are unclear
at this distance, their surviving melee armament
is invariably superb. Monoblades, kinesis wraps,
and other such SamaelTech weaponry all have +1
to hit and +1 damage. Some SamaelTech weapons appear to be decorated with Christian iconography and advanced nanotech cutting surfaces.
These pieces grant +2 to hit and damage.
Stardust Micropellet System: The “Stardust” system was
a cutting-edge effort to use gravitic manipulation
techniques in projectile weaponry. By giving a
tiny flake of matter the mass profile of a bullet, a
Stardust weapon never runs out of ammunition,
albeit Stardust weaponry cannot burst fire. Stardust weaponry gains +1 on all hit and damage rolls.
Tempus Fugit: The weapons of the Tempus Fugit armory employed Mandate temporal acceleration
generators. Such acceleration is exhausting to
the user, however, and creates severe strain on
a normal biological system. As an Instant action,

a wielder with the weapon in hand can take an
additional full round of action any time they
wish. At the end of this bonus action, they suffer
1d4 System Strain, +1 for each use of this ability
within the past 24 hours. If their System Strain is
maximized by this, they fall unconscious for one
hour. Tempus Fugit weapons have a +1 bonus to
hit and damage.
Terminus Est: A sister-company to Tempus Fugit, the
Terminus Est line of advanced melee weaponry
employed spatial distortion technology. As an
Instant action at the start of a round, a wielder
with the weapon in hand can nominate a visible
target; for the rest of the round, they’re treated as
if they’re adjacent and engaged in melee combat
with the target, hindering ranged attacks, subjecting them to attacks if they move away without a
fighting withdrawal, and so forth. The wielder is
not subject to attacks by the target unless they actually are within range of the target’s weapons. By
straining the wielder’s perception pathways, this
target nomination can be applied to a number of
targets equal to the wielder’s Stab skill plus two.
Any attack made against one target is applied to all
nominated targets, using the same die rolls. Each
round this multiple nomination is maintained, the
wielder takes 2 System Strain. All Terminus Est
weapons have a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls.
Tools of Ill Omen: A specialist weapon line designed by
sage-engineers affiliated with the Preceptors of
the Great Archive, the Tools are decorated with
taotie-motif fittings similar to those of Shang
Dynasty bronzes. Tools usually appear as melee
weapons, particularly halberds, dagger-axes and
swords, though stylized hypervelocity repeating
crossbows have been found that work like mag
rifles with unlimited ammo. The Tools function
with a +2 hit and damage bonus
Valiance Arms: Somewhat stodgy by pretech standards,
Valiance never embraced the more exotic potentials of pretech science. The company instead
preferred to focus on precision low-recoil projectile weapons and high-quality craftsmanship.
Valiance projectile weapons grant +2 to hit and
damage rolls.
Windcutter: Windcutter armaments are invariably
edged melee weapons. Their pretech manufacturers had an obsessive interest in maximizing weapon penetration, one carried to an extent that was
very impressive, if perhaps somewhat impractical
for field use. A Windcutter blade can slice through
any substance short of advanced pretech armor
plating, inflicting full normal damage on vehicles,
including gravtanks or other targets subject only
to Heavy weapons. For Shock purposes, all targets are treated as if they were AC 10. Against all
targets, the blades have an effective +1 bonus to
hit and damage.

Artifact Equipment

AI Companion: True AI was never easily made by pretech scientists. AIs required individual care during
their development, and a disturbing percentage of
them had to be “braked” at sub-human levels in
order to prevent runaway cogitation on imponderable philosophical questions and the ensuing
metastatic insanity that followed. Some AIs managed to attain a human level of sentience before
requiring brakes. The less brilliant of these AIs
could be contained in hardware no larger than five
or six centimeters on a side, usually with integral
sensors and vocalization units. If an AI companion
takes a liking to a PC, they can be useful allies; they
all have effective Program and Fix skills at level 3
or greater, and may have additional capabilities.
A distressing number of these AIs have their own
purposes, however, that are not necessarily complementary to those of their “owners”.
Integrity Stims: Usually found in the form of a skinspray applicator, integrity stims restore 2d6+2 hit
points to a subject for each dose applied. Each dose
increases the target’s System Strain by 1 point, and
the stims are useless to those with maximized System Strain. More than one dose can be triggered
into a subject in one round, but each dose after the
first adds an additional second System Strain point
from the sudden overload of stimulants.
Juggernaut Stims: Originally designed for pretech shock
troops, this skinspray stimulant charges the user
with fearless aggression and indifference to pain.
The user immediately gains 3d6 temporary hit
points and +2 to hit for a period of ten rounds. At
the end of that period, any remaining temporary
hit points are lost, and the subject suffers -2 to hit
for the next hour as their system recovers. Use of
this stim adds 1 point of System Strain.
Micropurgator Stims: A sprayhypo laden with a revivifying cocktail of nanites and support chemicals, a
micropurgator stim will remove 1d4 points of accrued System Strain from the user. Only one such
stim can be applied to a person within 24 hours.
Mindwall Helmet: A transparent-visored helmet, this
headpiece strengthens the integrity of the wearer’s
neural patterns, making it more difficult for them
to be influenced by mind-affecting psionic powers.
The wearer gains a +2 saving throw against any
such attack, and is automatically alerted by the
helmet if made the target of a telepathic power.
The helmet does not help against purely physical
psionic attacks, such as through telekinetics, and
it cannot be worn with powered armor, vacc suits,
or an assault suit.
Polymorphic Nanites: Usually found in two-kilo cylinders with integral input-output data ports,
polymorphic nanites were a late-Second Wave
development that promised to revolutionize
manufacturing. When fed a design schematic us-

ing standard pretech CAD/CAM protocols, the
nanites exude into the desired object, mimicking
any necessary physical properties. The nanites can
be used to create any object of equivalent or lesser mass, provided a datapad or the equivalent is
available to feed them the schematic. The nanites
are single-use, but multiple cylinders can be linked
together to create larger objects. The workmanship of the nanites is good, but not exceptional;
any available schematic of tech level 4 or less can
be produced.
Pseudonuke: While conventional TL4 nuke snuffers
make dangerous nuclear reactions impossible
near spaceships or modern civil defense systems,
a pseudonuke is designed with esoteric pretech
parts and techniques to bypass TL4 defenses. Most
pseudonukes are no larger than a briefcase but can
detonate with enough force to wipe out a large
city or space station. The handful created before
the Scream were deniable Mandate tools to deal
with rebel frontier colonies. Those that survive
are spectacularly illegal on almost all worlds.
Redivivus Sheath: When found, a redivivus sheath resembles a tightly-rolled body bag with a fist-sized
computing module affixed to it. When a freshly-dead human body is sealed into the bag the
module releases a cloud of nanites to repair and
revive the subject. Revivification will work on any
victim no more than five minutes dead, assuming
the head is intact and most of their mass is present.
Subjects are revived in critically wounded condition with maximized System Strain. The redivivus
sheath functions only once before burning out.
System Reset Inductor: An array of pretech pharmaceuticals of truly heroic breadth, a sprayhypo full of
system reset inductor is one of the most powerful
concoctions ever devised by pretech biochemists.
On injection, the subject immediately loses all accrued System Strain points barring those permanently added by cyberware. The user can gain new
System Strain normally, but 48 hours after the inductor has been administered, the strain will catch
up with them. They fall immediately unconscious
with 1 hit point and maximized System Strain, and
will remain in a coma for 48 hours before awakening. Use of a second inductor before the first has
run its course will inevitably kill the subject within
five rounds of application, with no hope of revival
by psionic disciplines or conventional medical aid.
Wideawake Serum: Originally designed to facilitate
spike drills for single-man ships that couldn’t afford a sleeping pilot, wideawake serum gives the
user enormous vigor and alertness for up to seven
days at a time. The user need not sleep or even rest,
but during this time it is impossible to recover
accrued System Strain. A successful Heal check at
difficulty 10, made at most once per day, can flush
the drug from the user prematurely.

90• Modding and Building Equipment

Modding and Building Equipment
While truly sophisticated research and design often
requires resources beyond the reach of an adventuring
party, more modest workshops can allow a talented
technician with a healthy supply of after-market parts
to improve the quality of their own or their allies’ gear.
Without a full-fledged R&D department behind them,
a PC technician is generally limited to modifying and
improving existing gear.
A mod is an adjustment made to a specific piece
of tech to make it work better. These mods are finicky,
delicate, and often customized to the user. They aren’t
generally available on the market because they require
regular tuning and adjustment by a highly-skilled technician in order to keep them from degrading, or even
failing entirely. Mods require costly after-market parts
that can be expensive to acquire, and the most sophisticated ones require actual pretech salvage stripped from
advanced ancient technology. Normally, only TL4 gear
can be effectively modded, as more primitive tech isn’t
suitable for the advanced components involved.

Installing Mods

Building and installing a mod requires a well-equipped
TL4 workshop. It’s not necessary to have a full-fledged
fabrication plant, but the sort of resources that a professional repair tech or vehicle shop have are necessary
to assemble and adjust the tech. Such a shop can usually
be rented for 100 credits a day, or bought outright in a
city or other urban area for 25,000 credits. A starship’s
“Workshop” ship fitting will also qualify.
Mods have a minimum Fix skill required to install
or maintain them; a Customized mod requires Fix-1, for
example, while a Flexible mod takes Fix-2. Without this
skill level, the tech can’t build or install the mod, and
they can’t maintain it properly either.
Mods have a cost in credits or salvage. A tech with
access to a normal TL4 parts market can buy components with a credit cost, but certain highly sophisticated
mods require pretech components that can only be salvaged from certain ancient Mandate-era technological
devices. Not just any device will do for gathering these
components; these micronized fusion taps, antigrav
nodules, impact flexors, and polymorphic state controllers are found in only certain Mandate tech or in
rare ancient caches of unused components. A tech will
usually have to find these components as part of an
adventure, because those who have them need them
for their own purposes and will not part with them for
ordinary monetary compensation. The specific details
of these parts don’t matter for mod use, and they’re simply tracked as “salvage”. If a mod requires three units of
salvage, any three units will work, and it’s not normally
necessary for a tech to track down specific components.
Mods take time to build and install. It takes one
week per minimum skill level of the mod to build and

install it in the desired device. Thus, a Customized mod
takes a week to put in, while a Flexible mod takes two.
If a tech does nothing other than work, eat, and sleep,
they can halve these times, and an additional assistant
with at least Fix-0 skill can further halve the time.
Mods must be custom-built to specific objects. A
tech cannot build a “generic” mod and then just attach
it to a device; it must be carefully designed to fit exactly with that specific item, and sometimes even with a
specific user.

Mods and Maintenance

Mods require maintenance to keep functioning correctly. Overclocked hardware, bleeding-edge tech, and
experimental adjustments just don’t have the field durability of more standard gear, so a tech must apply daily
attention to the modded hardware if it’s not to fail. A
normal TL4 toolbox is required to maintain mods, but
no special parts are needed.
A tech’s Maintenance score is equal to the total of
their Intelligence and Constitution modifiers plus three
times their Fix skill level. The smarter and the longer a
tech can work, the more maintenance they can perform,
but their overall expertise as a technician is the most
crucial element. A tech can maintain a number of mods
equal to their Maintenance score without cutting into
their adventuring time or otherwise encumbering their
off-duty hours. This maintenance is assumed to take
place during downtime and doesn’t need to be tracked
specifically in play. If they do nothing but maintenance,
they can double their score, but this kind of dedication
requires sixteen-hour workdays.
If a mod goes without maintenance for 24 hours, it
stops working. If a mod goes without maintenance for
a week, the entire device it’s attached to stops working,
as the untuned mod has made it useless or dangerous to
use. Weapons can no longer be used in combat, armor
no longer gives protection, seizes up, or is too dangerous to wear, and other devices simply stop functioning.
A maintenance backlog on a device can be cleared by an
hour of work by a technician capable of maintaining it.

Building Conventional Gear

Sometimes a wrench jockey will want to build their
own equipment rather than purchase it off the shelf.
This may be because there’s no such gear for sale, the
equipment is illegal on this world, the tech wants it
cheaper than the vendors sell it, or the tech wants
to build a custom platform for their favorite mods.
The gear built this way must be feasible to create in a
workshop; guns, armor, and modestly-sized vehicles
are possible, but starship components and other major
constructions are not.
A tech requires a TL4 workshop to build most TL4
equipment. More primitive gear can be built with less

Modding and Building Equipment •91
elaborate resources at the GM’s discretion. The workshop must be at least nominally capable of working with
the kind of gear the tech is building. A vehicle repair
shop will not have the tools to brew pharmaceuticals,
and a back-room electronics shop won’t have the lifts
to work on armored vehicles. If the tech needs to refit a
workshop to work on a particular type of unsupported
gear, they can pay half the shop’s original price to get
the needed tools. Starships with Workshop fittings are
always sufficient for personal gear modifications.
The tech needs a supply of parts. In any TL4 city
or sizable community, the tech can scrounge, barter,
or buy what they need from the locals. A tech working
in a shop out in the wilds can prepare by taking a few
footlockers full of materials that can fit in a vehicle or
on pack animals, buying a certain number of credits
worth of spare parts and hauling them along. Techs in
dire need can strip ancient high-tech ruins, battlefields,
and scrap heaps for parts if no better source is available.
Techs must decide whether the device they’re
building is to be jury-rigged, normal, or mastercrafted.
Jury-rigged devices are assembled out of cheap scrap,
bottom-tier components, and makeshift kludges.
They’re much cheaper to make than to buy, but they require constant attention to keep them operating. Normal devices work just as well as anything that you’d buy
off the shelf, but the lack of economies of scale and the
need to acquire all the parts at retail make them more
expensive than buying it off the shelf. Mastercrafted
gear is carefully built to support a tech’s own innovations and favorite modifications. They are extremely
expensive, but much easier to mod and maintain than
off-the-shelf tech.
Building the gear usually takes one month for a
vehicle and one week for a weapon, suit of armor, or
other portable device. Having at least one assistant with
Fix-0 will halve this time.
Jury-rigged devices cost one-quarter as much as
the normal device and take half the normal time to
build. If the tech has access to scrap or salvage, they
can assemble it at no cost, but it takes twice the normal
time to build it. A jury-rigged device counts as a mod
requiring Fix-0 to maintain. If it goes 24 hours without maintenance, it stops working. Jury-rigged devices
cannot be modded.
Normal devices cost twice as much as they would
off-the-shelf and take the normal amount of time to
build. They cannot be built with scrap or salvaged parts
unless the GM decides that the salvage is perfectly suited for this use. Drugs and other consumable goods must
be built as normal devices rather than jury-rigged or
mastercrafted ones.
Mastercrafted devices require costly premade
components and cost ten times as much as the normal
device, and require twice as much time to build. They
are ideal platforms for the tech’s own modifications,
however, and the first mod installed in the device requires no maintenance.

Sample Mods

The mods listed below are simply a sample of those a
GM might approve for their campaign. Weapon and
armor mods should not stack beyond a +3 bonus to AC,
hit rolls or damage rolls, and any mod improving a skill
check shouldn’t boost it by more than +1. A mod can
only be installed once on any given piece of equipment.
Autotargeting (Fix-2): The weapon has had micronized
kinetic targeting aids installed, granting a +1 bonus to hit rolls with it. Costs 4,000 credits.
Boosted (Fix-2): The weapon has been tuned for greater
damage output, adding +2 to the damage it does.
Costs 2,000 credits.
Bubbleseal (Fix-1): The armor is equipped with automatic pressure seals and emergency oxygen. It can
be triggered manually or activates automatically
on exposure to low pressure, functioning as a vacc
suit for up to one hour. Costs 5,000 credits.
Concealed (Fix-2): The device is disguised as a specific
different object of the same general mass. This
disguise will fool standard TL4 sensors, but not a
close physical inspection of the object. Costs ten
times the device’s base cost.
Customized (Fix-1): The weapon or armor has been
carefully tailored to a single specific user. When
used by that person, they get a +1 to hit with the
weapon or a +1 Armor Class bonus with armor.
Costs 1,000 credits and is inapplicable to shields.
Extended Magazine (Fix-1): The firearm has been adjusted so that its magazine size is doubled. Costs
500 credits.
Flexible (Fix-2): The armor is carefully tailored to a
specific wearer with an eye towards reducing its
weight and cumbersomeness. Its Encumbrance
value is lowered by 1 for that wearer, and increased by 1 for anyone else. Costs 5,000 credits.
High Efficiency (Fix-1): A device with a duration of
operation, such as a vacc suit or fueled vehicle,
now functions for 50% longer on the same charge.
Costs five times the device’s usual cost.
Infinite Magazine (Fix-3): The firearm now automatically produces its own physical ammunition. Costs
10,000 credits and two units of pretech salvage.
Infinite Power (Fix-3): A device powered by a Type A
power cell now never runs out of power. Costs
5,000 credits and one unit of pretech salvage.
Phasing (Fix-3): The weapon is tuned to partially phase
through armor and impeding debris, granting a +1
bonus to hit rolls with it. Costs 10,000 credits and
two units of pretech salvage.
Polymorphic Blending (Fix-2): The armor can shift in
appearance to that of normal clothing or different-looking armor. Several dozen different appearances can be loaded into it at any one time.
The armor functions and encumbers normally
regardless of its external appearance. Costs 5,000
credits and one unit of pretech salvage.

STARSHIPS
Countless ships rise from world upon world, the iron
dust of new-forged shipyards sent out to make bridges between the stars. For centuries, the privation and
chaos that followed the Scream have made any concern
beyond bare survival a luxury for all too many worlds.
The last century has seen a reawakening, however, as
myriad planets finally unlock the secrets of their own
worlds and learn to use their native resources to rebuild
the long-lost ships of their ancestors. The Silence is
ending and worlds are now beginning to reach out to
their unknown neighbors.
Different sectors have different degrees of development. In some regions of space, starships have now
been manufactured for centuries, with small spacecraft
easily obtained by private individuals and modest companies. These sectors have regular commerce between
worlds, with interstellar drills no more remarkable
than modern air travel. Aliens and offworlder humans
are noticed but go without special remark. These sectors often have relatively large stellar polities made up
of numerous member stars, ones which often share the
same general culture or political form. These sectors
may still have backward planets or unknown worlds,
but these are the exception.
In most Stars Without Number sectors, however,
things aren’t that developed. Some worlds will have
developed or retained functional shipyards and interstellar flight is not anything remarkable to their citizens,
but ownership of a starship is still a rare thing. Entire
planetary navies might have fewer than a dozen ships,
and only powerful and influential worlds will be sporting cruisers or other heavy warships. There is enough
commercial traffic to justify starports and trade stations,
but free and easy transit between worlds has been lost
for centuries, and is only slowly returning to the sector.
These sectors are rich in potential adventure. Even
developed worlds may not be completely familiar with
their stellar neighbors, and a number of lost worlds
and out-of-contact societies can still be found in the
sector. Starship captains can never be entirely certain
what they’re going to meet when they drill into such a
system, and no world is strong enough to exert its will
carelessly around distant stars.

Acquiring Starships

In most sectors, it’s possible to buy civilian starships
on any TL4 world. Such civilian ships are almost exclusively fighter or frigate-class hulls, most usually free
merchants or in-system shuttles, though a few wealthy
worlds offer bulk freighter hulls as well. These ships
might be armed to the extent that their buyer’s purse
allows, but they are no match for real warships, and
so few planets worry too much about who might buy
them. Conspicuous acquisition of numerous armed
merchants, however, might draw unwelcome interest.

Military hulls are a different matter. Even a lowly
patrol boat is rarely permitted to a civilian buyer, let
alone a fleet cruiser or other ship of the line. Even when
these ships can be purchased, crewing them adequately
can be far beyond the limits of an adventuring party’s purse. Even so, heroes who make the right friends
or do the right favors to a planetary government can
sometimes get letters of marque that entitle them to
purchase hulls that would not normally be allowed into
civilian hands.
Buying a ship is only one way to acquire it, however. Many adventurers find it more efficient to liberate
a craft from undeserving owners, with an evening’s
play revolving around the daring deeds and cunning
subterfuge needed to acquire or salvage a ship for the
party. Of course, the craft acquired by this means are
rarely in perfect condition.
The ship and fitting prices that follow in this section assume that starships are uncommon and expensive investments, as they are in most sectors. If you are
running a campaign in a region of easier access to ships,
you should halve or even quarter the prices.

Navies and Piracy

Most TL4 worlds have some sort of space navy, even if
it’s only a handful of patrol boats to watch the asteroid
mines and monitor orbital space around their homeworld. A typical poor world might have a corvette and
a half-dozen patrol boats, while the average TL4 planet
sports a fleet cruiser, four corvettes or heavy frigates,
and ten patrol boats, and a rich planet might have three
times as many ships, possibly even a battleship or carrier to form the heart of its fleet. A third of these ships
are usually in dock at any one time.
The threat of piracy varies from system to system.
Pirates need a safe place to refit their ships and sell their
stolen goods, and they need enough traffic to justify
their trade. The ideal pirate system is one containing
only a low-tech primitive world that can be raided for
slaves and supplies, with a hidden or mobile deep-space
repair base for maintenance, and two or more wealthy
neighboring systems that send trade through. Such a
pirate nest can persist for years, with system governments arguing over who should bear the cost of rooting
them out, or too weak to overcome a charismatic pirate
leader and their loot-hungry followers.
Very few pirates operate in a system with a strong
naval presence. Small ships can sometimes get away
with it for a time, hiding out in asteroid belts, striking
merchants from ambush, and fleeing to safer systems
before help can arrive. Larger pirate flotillas are a more
existential threat to a planetary navy, and they are soon
dispersed… or made the effective masters of the system
as they blow up any ship that could prevent them from
obtaining space supremacy.

94• Building a Starship

Building a Starship
Creating a starship in Stars Without Number is fairly
simple, and requires only a few steps.
First, pick a hull type for the ship from the list
below. The type will indicate the price of the base hull
with a drive-1 spike drive, along with the available free
power and mass.
Second, add fittings, weapons, and defenses from
the pages that follow. Each such addition takes up a
certain amount of power and mass, and may have a
minimum hull size required for installation. Some fittings and defenses cost more in money, power, or mass
when installed on larger ships.
Third, decide how many crew members the ship
will have. Most merchantmen run with no more than
twice the minimum number of crew to save on wages.
Warships rarely leave port with less than 75% of the
maximum crew allowed. On average, crew members

cost 100 credits a day in wages, plus 20 more for necessary food and stores. PCs, naturally, are unlikely to
charge themselves wages, but they need to eat.
Fourth, note down the six-month maintenance
cost of the ship, which is equal to 5% of its total noncrew cost. If this fee isn’t paid, a -1 penalty is applied to
all skill checks and hit rolls related to the ship for each
maintenance period skipped.
Lastly, fill in a ship record for the craft, marking
down the ship’s statistics and the attack bonuses for the
gunners using the ship’s weapons.
The speed of building or modifying a ship will depend on the quality of available shipyards and the political importance of the job. On average, 25,000 credits
a day of work or modifications can be done by most
shipyards on average-importance jobs. Enough reason
to rush can double or even quadruple this amount.

Starship Hulls
Starship hulls are divided into four general hull classes:
fighters, frigates, cruisers, and capital ships. The size
of each class varies depending on the technological sophistication and available resources of their creators. In
some sectors a smuggler’s free merchant frigate might
measure no more than 34.75 meters from nose to tail,
while in another it might be four times as large. As a
general proportion, each class’ average size is usually
from four to eight times larger than the class before it.
Each hull has several base attributes. Individual
models might vary slightly, and careful tuning and customization might alter these numbers as described later,
but most ships of a given hull type will perform as listed.
Cost is the price of the base hull with a drive-1
class spike drive. Any military hull type is generally
unavailable without very good naval contacts with a
shipyard’s owning government or a carefully-placed
favor to those in authority.
Speed is the relative combat speed and maneuverability of a ship. Over long distances a ship’s spike drive
rating is all that matters, but in the tight quarters of
combat this can make a great difference. A ship’s Speed
is added to all Pilot skill checks made by the craft’s pilot,
whether in combat or performing other maneuvers.
Armor is the measure of the ship’s plating and redundant systems, and is subtracted from any incoming
damage from hostile fire or hazardous space environments. Ship-mounted weapons with the Armor Piercing trait may ignore part or all of this rating. Ships
generally cannot be harmed by anything short of other
ship’s guns, vehicle-mounted Heavy weapons or carefully-placed demo charges.
Hit Points reflects the amount of damage the ship
can take before it explodes or becomes inoperable.

Crew lists the minimum crew necessary for basic
operation and the maximum crew the life support system can sustain for two months. Smaller crews than
the maximum will make the ship’s life support last proportionately longer. While it’s theoretically possible for
a lone crewman to make a successful spike drill, the
constant vigilance and wakefulness required mandates
the use of heavy pharmaceuticals and great desperation.
A minimum of three crew are normally required for a
relatively safe drill.
Armor Class is a combination of agility and effective ECM denoting the difficulty of landing a solid hit
on the ship.
Power is the amount of free power available after
the ship’s basic operation is taken into account. Fittings
and weapons take up some part of this power.
Mass records the amount of free mass left unassigned by the hull’s design. This free mass can be filled
with fittings, weapons, or cargo holds.
Hardpoints indicate how many weapons a ship can
successfully mount. Most weapons take up one hardpoint, though particularly large or power-hungry ones
may take up more than that.
Finally, the class of the particular hull shows the
general size of the ship. Some fittings and weapons
have a minimum hull class, beneath which a ship is
just too small to successfully install the hardware.
Starship hulls are sturdy enough to ignore damage
from small arms or TL3 Heavy weapons. TL4 Heavy
weapons or demo charges applied to the exterior of a
ship do half damage minus the ship’s Armor. If a saboteur gets inside with such weapons, the damage is
halved but Armor does not apply. Use of some Heavy
weapons in confined areas may be decidedly imprudent.

Building a Starship •95

Hull Types

The hull types listed below are some of the most common models found throughout the remnants of human space. Individual worlds often experiment with
different vessels as they gradually develop their own
astronautic doctrines, but these models have the benefit
of long and proven utility.
Strike Fighter: Small craft, often modified to replace
the spike drive with a system drive. Their speed,
cheapness, and combat utility make them a popular choice as inexpensive system patrol craft.
Shuttle: The smallest craft that’s regularly used for interstellar drills, a shuttle is a cheap means of moving
small amounts of precious material or important
persons between worlds.
Free Merchant: A hull type much beloved by adventurers, a free merchant has unimpressive combat
utility but can carry substantial amounts of cargo
while mounting enough weaponry to discourage
small-craft piracy.
Patrol Boat: The hull of choice for customs cutters and
system law enforcement, the patrol boat is a light
frigate built heavy enough to overawe small merchant vessels while still being relatively cheap to
build and crew.
Corvette: The smallest true combat frigate, and often
simply called a “frigate” by spacers. Corvettes have
significantly thicker armor than patrol boats and
trade additional crew needs and less maneuverability for more available free mass.
Heavy Frigate: The heaviest starship that most poor
or resource-deprived worlds can build, the heavy
frigate can carry a significant loadout of weaponry
and has enough crew to overwhelm most pirate
ships if it comes to a boarding action. While it
packs a substantial punch, it lacks the armor of a
true cruiser-class warship.
Bulk Freighter: This class of huge cargo ship is found
most often in peaceful, heavily-populated sectors.

Fleet Cruiser: The favored ship of the line of most
wealthy, advanced worlds, and often the biggest
and most powerful ship most planets can build. A
cruiser’s heavy armor and infrastructural support
for heavy guns make it a lethal weapon against
frigates and any other ship not optimized for
cracking heavy armor. They can prove vulnerable to swarm attacks by fighter-bombers equipped
with the right kind of armor-piercing weapons.
Battleship: Dreaded hulks of interstellar war, very few
worlds have the necessary technology or economy
to support the massive expense of building and
crewing a battleship. Those that do gain access
to a ship that is largely invulnerable to anything
short of specially-designed anti-capital cruisers or
hunter-killer frigates.
Carrier: The queen of a fleet, even fewer polities can
afford to build one of these huge ships. Carriers
can support flights of fighter or frigate-class warships, ones specially equipped to handle particular
missions. This versatility allows it to load fighter-bombers for anti-capital missions one month,
and then switch to swarms of hunter-killer frigates the next when a hostile system’s asteroid outposts need to be destroyed. Stripped of its combat
wings, however, a carrier has less individual firepower than a cruiser.
Stations: Almost every space-faring world has at least
one space station in orbit. A station has no Speed
score, no spike drive, and cannot perform any
maneuvers in combat, though its transit jets can
slowly move it around a solar system over a matter
of weeks. Civilian trade stations allow for docking
by bulk freighters and ships not cleared to land on
the surface, while military stations strictly forbid
any civilian docking. The small station listed here
is a Bannerjee-12, a common model found on poor
or backwater worlds with little traffic. The large
station represents an Arx, a major trade station for
a hub world with money to spare.

96• Building a Starship

Starship Fittings
The following list of ship fittings are largely standard
TL4 technologies that are available in most sectors. A
few items on the list are rare pretech devices that cannot be acquired without special connections or a lucky
feat of salvage.
Some costs are marked with an asterisk. These
costs are multiplied by 10 when the fitting is installed
in a frigate-class hull, by 25 when installed in a cruiser-class hull, and by 100 when installed in a capital ship.
Some power and mass entries are marked with a
hashmark. These costs are multiplied by 2 for frigates,
3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital ships, rounded up. Note
that you apply these multipliers even if the fitting only
works on a large ship; a frigate with a Drill Course Regulator pays 250,000 credits, not 25,000.
Advanced research lab: A lab suitable for investigating
alien xenolife, planetary geology, esoteric technology, and other mysteries of the cosmos. The lab
contains cold sleep pods adequate to contain alien
samples, viro-shielded research cells, high-energy
lasers, and other requisite tools. When used to investigate some phenomenon or object, any applicable skill rolls are improved by +1 for a frigate lab,
+2 for a cruiser lab, and +3 for a capital ship lab.
Advanced nav computer: Forging new spike courses is
too much an art to rely on computerized assistance, but an advanced nav computer can help on
well-mapped routes. When navigating an interstellar drill course with charts less than a year old,
the navigator decreases drill difficulty by 2.
Amphibious operation: This fitting includes the benefits
of the Atmospheric Configuration fitting, as well as
allowing the ship to operate while immersed in a
liquid medium. Submerged ships cannot be detected with conventional planetary traffic sensors
and require military sonar and naval sensors to fix
their position, resources often unavailable on less
developed worlds. So long as the ship stays away
from military naval craft and bases, it is almost
impossible to track while submerged. Only fighter
and frigate hull classes can mount this fitting.
Armory: Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship
equipment, a captain can simply buy an armory.
Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4
military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew
might require, and integral maintenance facilities
for its upkeep. There is enough gear available to
outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving
it away or losing it in use may deplete it.
Atmospheric configuration: This fitting must be put
in place when the ship is built, and cannot be
installed on cruiser-class or larger ships. A ship
designed for atmospheric flight can land on most
solid or aqueous surfaces.

Auto-targeting system: Some ships run with more guns
than crewmen. A single NPC or PC can man one
gun per round, firing it as often as the gunnery
chief’s Fire One Weapon or Fire All Guns actions
allow, but sometimes that’s not enough. Installing
an autonomic targeting system for a gun allows it
to shoot at a +2 hit bonus without human assistance. This system must be installed once for each
gun that is to be self-manned.
Automation support: The ship has been carefully fitted
to support the use of non-sentient expert system
robots in its operation. At least one human, VI,
or True AI crew member is necessary to oversee
the bots and monitor spike drills, but otherwise
crew may be replaced with cheap, basic robots at
a cost of 1,000 credits per crew member replaced.
Bots don’t draw pay, don’t take up life support,
and their maintenance is assumed to be part of the
ship’s operating costs. These bots are incapable of
any actions unrelated to operating the ship and
are treated as level-0 in their skills where relevant.
Boarding tubes: Armored tubes equipped with laser cutter apertures can be used to forcibly invade a hostile ship, provided the target’s engines have been
disabled. Ships without boarding tubes have to
send invaders across empty space to either make
an assault on a doubtless heavily-guarded airlock
or cut their way in through the hull with laser
cutters and half an hour of work.
Cargo lighter: Cruisers and larger craft can’t land on
planetary bodies, so they require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter is only capable
of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly
twenty minutes either way, but can latch on to
a standard pressurized cargo container holding
up to 200 tons of cargo and passengers. These
containers are usually collapsible and take up no
significant space when compressed for storage, assuming they’re not simply disposable cargo shells.
This fitting can be purchased multiple times.
Cargo space: Free mass can be traded for pressurized
cargo space. Tracked by weight for convenience,
one cubic meter is usually one ton, with most vehicles requiring ten tons when loaded, tanks taking 25, and aircraft or mechs taking up 50 tons of
cargo space. One point of free mass grants 2 tons
of cargo space in a fighter, 20 tons in a frigate, 200
tons in a cruiser, and 2000 tons in a capital-class
ship. This fitting can be purchased multiple times.
Cold sleep pods: These stasis pods can keep a subject
alive for centuries provided that the ship’s power
doesn’t fail. Each installation allows for keeping
a number of people equal to the ship’s maximum
crew in stasis indefinitely. This fitting can be installed multiple times.

98• Building a Starship
Colony core: The ship has been designed to act as the
core of a future settlement. Once this fitting is
engaged, the ship ceases to be operational as a
starship, and builds out into a set of habitats, hydroponic gardens, fusion plants, and living spaces
sufficient to support up to five times its maximum
crew, including enough fabrication and workshop
facilities to keep the settlement operational under normal conditions. The settlement can be a
deep-space hab, orbital installation, or planetary
settlement. In the latter case, the ship must land
to form the settlement; even ships without atmospheric operations can do so, but they can never
take off again. Once activated, a colony core cannot be re-packed.
Drill course regulator: Drills along a known spike drive
route have no chance of failure so long as the route
is no longer than twice the operating pilot’s skill
level and does not involve course trimming. Thus,
a navigator with Pilot-1 skill would always succeed
in making a drill of two hexes or less, provided the
route was a known one. The drill course regulator requires a sophisticated technical base and
compatible metadimensional energy conditions
in a given sector; many sectors no longer have
this technology or lack the right environment to
use it. If the GM prefers a campaign where space
travel is always at least somewhat dangerous, they
may deny access to this fitting. Ships piloted by
exceptionally talented navigators may choose not
to mount it even then.
Drive upgrades: A ship can improve its standard-issue
drive-1 spike drive with additional phase filters
and power throughput refinements. A captain
needs buy only the final grade of drive desired. He
does not have to buy upgrades sequentially. Drives
of rating 4 and higher are generally TL5 artifacts
that cannot be built most modern worlds.
Drop pod: Armored and stealthed versions of cargo
lighters, these craft are twice as fast, apply a -3
penalty to tracking and targeting skill checks, and
can carry up to one hundred troops or passengers.
Many are equipped with assorted Heavy weapons
to clear the landing zone, and can be treated as
flight-capable gravtanks for purposes of combat.
This fitting can be purchased multiple times.
Emissions dampers: Stealth systems can mask the ship’s
energy emissions through careful modulation of
the output. All travel times inside a star system are
doubled when the system is engaged, but any skill
checks to avoid detection gain a +2 bonus.
Exodus bay: These banked rows of compressed cold
sleep pods are designed to carry enormous numbers of people in extended hibernation, most often colonists to some new homeworld or escapees
from some stellar disaster. A cruiser can carry up
to 1,000 colonists in stasis, while a capital ship
can handle up to 5,000. Each further time this fit-

ting is selected, these numbers double. These pods
put their inhabitants into very deep hibernation
so as to minimize the resources necessary to maintain their lives. Bringing them out of this stasis
requires a month of “defrost”. Crash awakenings
have a 25% chance of killing the subject. The pods
are rated for 100 years of stasis, but their actual
maximum duration is somewhat speculative.
Extended life support: The ship can be designed to accommodate a larger number of crew or passengers.
Extended life support can be fitted multiple times;
each time, the maximum crew rating of the ship
increases by 100% of its normal maximum. Thus,
a free merchant who installs this twice can have a
maximum complement of 18 people.
Extended medbay: All ships are equipped with basic
medical facilities for curing lightly injured crew
members and keeping the seriously injured ones
stable until reaching a planet. An extended medbay improves those facilities, allowing for the
medical treatment of up to the ship’s entire maximum crew at once, including the treatment of
critically wounded passengers.
Extended stores: A normal complement of ship’s stores
can keep the maximum crew size supplied for two
months. Each selection of Extended Stores doubles
that time, and can be fitted multiple times.
Fuel bunkers: Most ships require refueling after each
drill jump, no matter the distance. Installing fuel
bunkers allows the ship to carry one additional
load of fuel. This fitting can be installed multiple
times for ships that wish to minimize fueling.
Fuel scoops: Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and
extraction of hydrogen from gas giants or the
penumbra of solar bodies. The extraction process
requires four days of processing and refinement,
but completely refuels the ship. Such fittings are
common on explorer craft that cannot expect to
find refueling stations.
Hydroponic production: Some ships are designed to produce food and air supplies for the crew. Selecting
hydroponic production allows for the indefinite
supply of a number of crewmen equal to the ship’s
maximum crew. This option may be taken multiple times for farm ships, in which case each additional selection doubles the number of people the
ship can support.
Lifeboats: Selecting this fitting equips the ship with
a number of single-use escape craft capable of
reaching the nearest habitable planet or station
in a star system. If no such destination exists,
the boats can maintain their passengers for up
to a year in drugged semi-stasis. Lifeboats have
fully-functional comm systems and are usually
equipped with basic survival supplies and distress
beacons. A single selection of this fitting provides
enough lifeboats for a ship’s maximum crew, with
up to twenty people per boat.

of the ship’s maximum crew gain access to luxury cabins of a spaciousness sufficient to please
a wealthy star-farer. This fitting comes with the
usual zero-gee athletic courts, decorative fountains, fine dining, and artistic fittings.
Mobile extractor: Automated mining and refinery
equipment has been built into the ship, allowing
it to extract resources from asteroids and planetary surfaces. Careful extraction of specific lodes
of valuable minerals can be quite profitable at the
GM’s discretion, but if the crew is simply melting down available asteroids for raw materials,
the unit can refine one ton of usable materials
per day worth about 500 credits in most markets.
These raw materials can be used to feed a mobile
factory, and a ship may have more than one mobile extractor fitted to it to multiply the return
if sufficient raw feedstock is available. Operating
an extractor requires at least five crew members.
Mobile factory: The ship is equipped with a full-scale
TL4 fabrication plant programmed to support its
needs. The ship can stock raw materials and parts
at 5,000 credits per ton; these parts can then be
used to “pay” ship repair or maintenance costs
when conventional shipyards are unavailable. The
factory can also create and repair vehicles, TL4
equipment, space habs, and planetary structures
with these parts at a rate of 10,000 credits worth
of construction a day. If a mobile extractor is
available, the raw materials processed by the latter unit can be used to feed the factory. Operating
a mobile factory requires at least 100 well-trained
personnel. Each 10 fewer available doubles repair
or maintenance times.

Precognitive nav chamber: An extremely rare example
of psitech dating from before the Scream, a precognitive nav chamber allows a character with at
least Precognition-2 psionic skill to assist in interstellar drills, sensing impending shear alterations
before they happen. The navigator automatically
succeeds on any spike drill check of difficulty 9 or
less. On a failed check, add 2 to the Spike Drive
Mishap roll, limiting the potential damage. On
drilling in to the destination system, the psychic
has expended all Effort in the process.
Psionic anchorpoint: This pretech relic is unavailable on
the open market in most sectors. Once installed
in a ship, it can be “imprinted” by up to a dozen
psychics. These psychics can sense and affect any
object or location within ten meters of the relic
after one minute of concentration, provided they
are within the same solar system. Thus, teleporters can always teleport next to the anchorpoint,
telepaths can always contact anyone within the
affected zone, telekinetics can manipulate objects
near the relic, and so forth. The relic can be recoded to eliminate existing imprints, but any psychic who gets access to the relic for ten minutes of
meditation and focus can imprint on it afterwards.
There is no obvious way to tell how many psychics
have imprinted to the anchorpoint.
Sensor mask: The ship can disguise its long-range sensor readings, spoofing scans with the ID tags and
apparent hull type of any other ship of its choice.
To penetrate this masquerade, the scanning entity must beat a Wis/Program skill check against
difficulty 10 plus the Program skill of the masking ship’s comms officer. Once the ship is close
enough to visually identify, the masking is useless.

100• Building a Starship
Ship bays: These sophisticated docking bays provide
all the necessary tools and support for launching
a starship from the mother craft. They are rarely seen outside of dedicated capital-class carriers,
but some cruisers make room to mount a fighter-class attack shuttle. Each bay allows room for
one ship of the appropriate hull class. While the
carried ship can support its own crew if necessary, most carriers fold their space wing into the
mothership’s crew roster. This fitting can be taken
multiple times.
Ship’s locker: Much like an armory, this option allows
a captain to lay in a general supply of equipment
likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any
TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in
the ship’s locker in amounts commensurate with
the ship’s size. A few guns and some basic armor
might be included as well, but for serious armament an armory is required. There is enough gear
available to outfit the entire crew for normal use,
but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete
the locker until it is restocked.
Shiptender mount: The ship is designed with symbiosis
mounts that allow other ships to “hitch” on the
craft’s spike drills. Each shiptender mount allows
one craft of a hull size smaller than the tender to
link up for intersystem drills. Mounts cannot be
used for in-system travel. If the linking ship has
been designed to be carried by a tender then establishing this link takes one hour. If not, it takes
a full day to fit the ship into the mount. Ships can
dismount from the tender with an hour’s disentanglement. In an emergency, the carried ships can
dismount instantly, but the mountings are considered disabled then until repairs are made. Carried
ships cannot fight.
Smuggler’s hold: Carefully-designed storage space intended to conceal illicit cargo from customs inspection. Each installation of this fitting adds 200
kilograms of cargo space in a fighter, 2 tons in a
frigate, 20 tons in a cruiser, or 200 tons in a capital ship. Cargo in a smuggler’s hold will never be
found by a standard customs inspection. Careful
investigation by a suspicious official can find it on
a difficulty 10 check using their Wis/Notice skill,
and a week-long search one step short of disassembly will find it on a difficulty 7 check.
Survey sensor array: Most ships require only basic
analysis of a star system, sufficient to identify
population centers, do rough scanning of an object’s composition, and chart major navigational
hazards. Survey sensor arrays greatly enhance
the ship’s sensor abilities, allowing for finely-detailed mapping of objects and planets, along with
broad-spectrum communications analysis. They
also improve attempts to detect other craft when
scanning a region for stealthy vessels. Any rolls
with survey sensor arrays add +2 to skill checks.

System drive: The ship’s standard drive-1 spike drive is
removed and replaced with a different propulsion
system. The ship is still treated as having a drive-1
for maneuvering and system transit purposes, but
it cannot make interstellar drills. This modification lowers the cost of the basic hull by 10% and
adds extra power and space based on the size of
the hull: 1 power for fighters, 2 for frigates, 3 for
cruisers, and 4 for capital ship hulls. Twice this
amount of free mass is gained by the process.
Teleportation pads: This TL5 tech is completely unavailable in most sectors and was uncommon even on
Mandate-era ships. The pads allow up to a dozen
people or 1,200 kilograms of matter to be teleported to and from the surface of a planet or the
interior of a another ship, provided it is no more
than a few tens of thousands of kilometers distant.
Ship-to-ship teleportation is possible only when
the receiving ship is cooperating by transmitting
accurate coordinate details; otherwise, a friendly,
unjammed signal from inside is necessary to lock
onto the target point. Planetary teleportations are
possible only in the absence of physical barriers
between the ship and the target point below. The
teleporters may be used once every five minutes.
In those rare sectors where this tech is widely
available, it costs 200k.
Tractor beams: Gravitic projectors allow the ship to manipulate objects within its immediate area, pushing, pulling, and sliding objects no larger than a
ship of one hull class smaller. Targets with shipscale propulsion can resist the beams, but lifeboats,
individual suit jets, or other smaller propulsors
are inadequate. The beam can focus on only one
object at a time but can move it into the ship’s
cargo bays or hurl it out of the ship’s immediate
vicinity within three rounds. The beams can only
effectively manipulate objects in very low gravity,
and not those on the surface of planets or other
objects with significant natural gravity.
Vehicle transport fittings: The ship has been fitted with
specialized mounts, bunking, cargo bays, and
other facilities to expedite the transport of often-unwieldy vehicles, including mechs and other
military craft. Any vehicles carried count as only
half their usual cargo tonnage. Assuming trained
operators, up to four vehicles can be offloaded or
ramped onto the ship per round in cases where
speed is critical.
Workshops: On-board workshops can be bought at
smaller than maximum sizes than a hull would allow, if additional TL4 tech facilities aren’t strictly
needed. A frigate-sized workshop is sufficient for
modding any personal gear as per the modification
rules on page 100. A cruiser-sized workshop can
handle vehicle modding and starship maintenance,
and a capital-class workshop can build vehicles or
similar large work from scratch at full cost.

Building a Starship •101

Starship Defenses
The defenses listed here are some of the more common
ones installed in modern TL4 starships. Most non-warships mount little or nothing in the way of special defenses, preferring to save the hull space for cargo and
immediately useful fittings.
Ablative Hull Compartments: By sacrificing empty hull
space in a complex system of ablative blast baffles,
a capital-class ship can have a large amount of its
total mass shot away without actually impinging
on its normal function. This grants it a +1 AC
bonus and 20 extra maximum hit points.
Augmented Plating: At the cost of a certain amount of
speed and maneuverability, a ship can have its armor plating reinforced against glancing hits, gaining a +2 bonus to its AC. This augmentation can
decrease a ship’s Speed below 0, meaning it will
be applied as a penalty to all Pilot tests.
Boarding Countermeasures: The ship has hardened
bulkheads, reinforced hatches, and specially-designed automated kill corridors for wiping out
intruders. Provided that the ship’s bridge is still
under control, the operator can prevent entry to
the ship by any force that lacks shipyard-grade
tools, weapons capable of melting hull plating,
or specialized military breaching implements. If
intruders do get inside, only well-equipped, specially-trained marines have any real chance of
breaching the defenses. Ordinary space pirates or
more casual invaders have only a 1 in 6 chance
of threatening the bridge crew, though they may
cause significant damage in their dying.
Burst ECM Generator: A high-powered secondary ECM
generator can be activated to negate any one otherwise-successful hit against the ship. This generator can be activated after the damage has been
rolled, but enemy ships rapidly compensate for the
new ECM source, and so the generator can only
be used effectively once per engagement.

Foxer Drones: These drones are invariably short-lived
due to the enormous energy signatures they produce, but until the ship’s next turn they grant a +2
AC bonus as their emissions confuse foes. Foxer
drones are cheaply constructed and essentially
free; the only limit on their number is the amount
of free space set aside for holding them.
Grav Eddy Displacer: This system links with a ship’s
navigational subsystem and randomizes the motion vectors in sympathy with metadimensional
gravitic currents. This agility gives any hit on the
ship a 1 in 6 chance of being negated entirely.
Hardened Polyceramic Overlay: A complex glazing process can harden the surface of a ship’s armor to
more effectively shed incoming attacks, decreasing the armor-piercing quality of any hit by 5.
Planetary Defense Array: The ship is equipped with
an array of gravitic braker guns and an upgraded nuke snuffer field. While useless in conventional ship-to-ship combat, the array can deflect
or dampen meteor impacts, dropped penetrator
rods, or other non-powered bombardment techniques, and the snuffer field is powerful enough
to prevent nuclear fission reactions over a hemisphere-sized area. A single ship with a PDA can
protect against any natural meteor strikes and
deny easy terror bombardment of a planet’s population. The PDA cannot fully protect against
orbital strikes by powered penetrators, but it can
nudge them off course and make pinpoint strikes
impractical. Most developed planets have much
more powerful and effective ground installations,
but a PDA-equipped ship is a useful emergency
stopgap for poor or primitive worlds.
Point Defense Lasers: Too small to damage ships, these
point defense lasers can detonate or melt incoming munitions, improving the ship’s defenses
against torpedoes, fractal impact charges, and
other ammunition-based weapons.

102• Building a Starship

Starship Weaponry
Space is dangerous, and most ships mount the best
weapons their purse and their ship’s infrastructure
can support. While most worlds limit the purchase of
warships by civilians, few place restraints on the type
of weapons a civilian ship can mount.
Ship weaponry tends to come in two classes. One
class of weapon is damaging and has moderate power and mass demands, but has comparatively weak
armor-piercing capabilities. Another class of weapon is expensive, taxing to a ship’s systems, and may
have somewhat inferior damage, but it has enough armor-piercing to affect a warship of a hull size one step
larger than the mounting starship.
The choice of which class of weapon to mount
usually depends on the type of opposition the designer
expects the ship to face. Most civilian ships favor the
former kind, as few expect to engage true warships.

Weapon Qualities

Ammo: The weapon or defense requires ammunition
to fire. Each round’s cost is listed after the weapon’s cost, and a number of rounds equal to the
weapon’s Ammo rating can be fit into one free
mass unit. For example, a torpedo launcher can fit
the magazine and loading gear for four torpedoes
into one free mass unit, and each torpedo will cost
2,500 credits. For each ship class larger than the
minimum required to mount the weapon, double
the stored ammo per unit. The weapon itself includes one free mass unit worth of ammunition
as part of the installation, so simply mounting a
torpedo launcher alone on a frigate gives the ship
four rounds of ammo.
AP: The weapon ignores this many points of a target’s
armor. The Hardened Polyceramic Overlay defense
upgrade may lessen the effectiveness of this quality. The most a weapon’s AP rating can do is reduce
a target’s effective armor to zero. It cannot add
additional damage to a hit.
Cloud: The weapon fires an omni-directional wave
or spray of projectiles. It automatically targets
all fighter-class ships that have attacked the ship
within the past round, and the gunner may make
one attack roll against each target. Cloud weapons
have no effect on ships larger than fighter-class
hulls or intruders who are actually on the hull.
Clumsy: Either through a slow discharge time or unwieldy engineering requirements, this weapon
suffers -4 to hit small fighter-class hulls.
Flak: These weapons launch vast numbers of small
energy discharges or projectiles, and are particularly dangerous to small ships that rely on speed
over thick armor. Against fighter-class hulls, these
weapons roll hit rolls and damage rolls twice and
take the better result.

Weapon Descriptions

Each weapon listed below has a cost, the damage die it
uses on a hit, and the amount of hardpoints, free power,
and mass it takes up in a hull. The minimum hull class
required to mount it is also listed, as is the minimum
tech level to manufacture it.
All ship weapon attack and damage rolls use the
better of the gunner’s Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers. Most use Shoot as the relevant skill, though Pilot
can be used for the guns of a fighter-class ship.

Multifocal Laser: Twinned assay and penetration lasers modulate the frequency of this beam for remarkable armor penetration. These weapons are
popular choices for fighters intended for frigate
or cruiser engagement.
Reaper Battery: Stepped tapping of the spike drive
power plant allows for the emission of a torrent
of charged particles. The particles have very little
armor penetration, but can fry a small ship’s power grid in a strike or two.
Fractal Impact Charge: A spray of penetrator sabots that
use fractal surfacing to increase impact. Favored
for bomber-class fighter hulls.
Polyspectral MES Beam: A rare example of pretech
weaponry, a fighter equipped with a PMB can
scratch even a battleship’s hull.
Sandthrower: Projecting a spray of tiny, dense particulate matter, sandthrowers are highly effective
against lightly-armored fighters.
Flak Emitter Battery: A baseline frigate anti-fighter system, this battery fires waves of lasers or charged
particles to knock down small craft.
Torpedo Launcher: Capable of damaging even a battleship, torpedoes are cumbersome, expensive, and
often the core of a line frigate’s armament.
Charged Particle Caster: A focalized upgrade to the
reaper battery, the CPC has a much better armor
penetration profile.
Plasma Beam: With superior targeting and a smaller
energy drain than a CPC, a plasma beam sacrifices
some armor penetration.
Mag Spike Array: A storm of magnetically-accelerated
spike charges is almost guaranteed to eradicate any
fighter-class craft it hits.
Nuclear Missiles: Useless in ship-to-ship combat or
against any other TL4 planet with working nuke
snuffers, one of these missiles can still erase an
entire lostworlder city without such protection.
Spinal Beam Cannon: One of the first spinal-mount class
weapons, the SBC briefly channels the full power
of the ship into a charged beam. It lacks the power
and penetration of the more advanced gravcannon, but also takes less power to mount.

Building a Starship •103
Smart Cloud: A swarm of self-directed microdrones
sweeps over the ship. Their integral beam weaponry is too small to damage larger ships, but they
can wipe out an attacking fighter wave.
Gravcannon: Using much the same principles as
man-portable grav weaponry, the gravcannon
causes targets to fall apart in a welter of mutually-antagonistic gravitic fields.
Spike Inversion Projector: The SIP uses the ship’s spike
phasing as an offensive weapon, penetrating the
target with a brief incursion of MES energies that
largely ignore attempts to evade.
Vortex Tunnel Inductor: A capital-class model of the SIP,
a VTI is capable of incapacitating a cruiser in two
hits. Its bulk limits its utility against fighter-class
craft, however.
Mass Cannon: By firing projectiles almost as large as
fighter-scale craft, the mass cannon inflicts tremendous damage on a target. Serious ammunition
limitations hamper its wider-scale use.
Lightning Charge Mantle: Modulation of the ship’s
power core emits a cloak of MES lightning. While
larger spike drive craft can shunt the energies
away harmlessly, fighter-class ships are almost
invariably destroyed if hit.
Singularity Gun: One of the few surviving pretech
weapons in anything resembling wide currency,
this capital-class weapons system fires something
mathematically related to a miniaturized black
hole at a target.
Ship Weapon

Ground Weapons vs. Ships
On rare occasions, PCs will have to deal with small
arms fire against their spaceship, or evade ground
guns when trying to escape a port or land safely
on a hostile world.
As a basic rule of thumb, hostile TL3 small
arms fire does no damage, TL4 small arms fire
does 1d6 damage per ten minutes of persistent
gunfire, and Heavy weapons do half their rolled
damage, minus the ship’s Armor. Multiple Heavy
weapons blazing away at a grounded free merchant can reduce it to unflyable scrap in short
order, but a peppering of mag rifle fire is unlikely
to do serious damage to a ship that decamps with
sufficient speed.
It is impossible to miss a grounded ship. The
Armor Class of a ship in flight will vary with the
situation; AC 10 for hovering nearby, AC 15 for
close-to-earth flight, and AC 20 if the ship is simply flying within weapon range.
Active ground-placed anti-ship defenses are
a different matter. These massive lasers and energy projectors are absolutely lethal at atmospheric
ranges. Avoiding them is a Pilot skill check at a
GM-chosen difficulty of 8 to 10 for each round the
ship is exposed, suffering 2d10 damage with AP
20 on each miss. A desperate ship can get outside
the gun’s firing angle if it can survive three rounds
of this peril.

The standard drill-capable fighter craft of most TL4
polities, this model retains a spike drive instead of replacing it with a cheaper systems drive. While the lone
pilot would have to be desperate and heavily drugged
to make an entire spike drill solo, it remains an option
when no larger craft is available.
This particular model is equipped with a reaper
battery for dealing with small, lightly-armored civilian ships. “Bomber”-type fighters usually replace this
with a fractal impact charge to threaten larger warships,
while fighters built to dogfight their peers favor fitting
a multifocal laser.

This craft is a conventional civilian shuttle, albeit one
with a spike drive sufficient to get it to a neighboring
system and enough passenger space to make it a minimally-acceptable transport for brave VIPs and light
cargo. If used as an inter-system transport, however, at
least three crew will be needed to safely navigate a drill.
While cheap and flexible, the shuttle is entirely
unarmed and acutely vulnerable to piracy or hostile
warships. In such cases the pilot’s only recourse is to
surrender or hope the small craft’s nimble maneuver
drives can keep it away from the attacker long enough
to get to safety.

775K base price, 38,750 maintenance,
131,400 yearly crew cost for 3 crew

A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers
throughout human space, the standard free merchant
is an extremely versatile craft, capable of hauling significant amounts of cargo to neighboring systems while
requiring very few hands to operate it. Only one crew
member is needed for in-system flight, though spike
drills require three for normal margins of safety.
The standard free merchant is not a warship, but
its sandthrower is enough to discourage pirate shuttles
and the other small or fragile craft that wreckers or
primitive worlds tend to favor. The multifocal laser
is ideal for a highly-skilled gunner who can snipe out
important systems on an attacking vessel, but the ship
lacks the armor and durability to stand up to a true warship. Of course, with a sufficiently expert crew, even a
corvette might be threatened by the well-aimed guns
of a small craft like this.

Patrol boats are often the largest ships fielded by poor
or backward frontier worlds that lack the shipyard facilities or available resources to build bigger military
craft. Even so, the ability to field two patrol boats for
the yearly maintenance cost of one corvette often appeals even to richer worlds that need more coverage
than their available craft can provide.
Patrol boats are the smallest independent warships
fielded by most navies, as fighters are not normally
considered capable of extended independent operation. They have considerable spike drive reach and are
faster in-system than most of their potential targets.
While their single mounted gun is vulnerable to being
disabled by expert enemy gunners, the relatively thick
armor of the ship and skilled damage control crew can
mitigate that danger. A few patrol boats replace their
survey sensor array with a sandthrower to up-gun the
ship, but most prefer the additional edge in scanning
potential smugglers.
The usual ship of the line of most modestly-funded
frontier navies, a corvette is a true warship, albeit of
a minimal size. While it is unable to land on worlds
with standard gravity, its cargo lighter allows crew and
cargo transit from the surface of a world, and its extended stores allow for more than four months of field
operation under normal crew parameters.
Most pirates flying reworked free merchants
or stolen patrol boats will turn tail as soon as a corvette shows up in the region. Good armor, multiple
ship-killing guns, and trained boarding marines make
a corvette a death sentence to most stellar ruffians, and
even when a pirate wolf pack can bring one down, it
usually comes at the cost of crippling damage.
The model depicted here is standard for anti-piracy and basic system defense missions. Against cruiser-class warships, however, this corvette’s weapons
have insufficient armor penetration to seriously threaten such a major warship.
Sometimes confusingly called a “light cruiser”, a heavy
frigate pushes the engineering parameters of a frigate
hull to the maximum available to most TL4 worlds.
Equipped with a torpedo launcher capable of threatening even cruiser-class enemies, the heavy frigate
can intimidate any ship of its weight class. Its heavy
crew complement and military drop pod fitting allow
it to quickly dispatch well-armed marines to hot spots
throughout a solar system.
However, despite the large weapon loadout, the
heavy frigate remains a frigate. Its armor is significantly inferior to that of a true cruiser-class warship, and
most frigates built for same-class engagements can be
a meaningful threat to it. It comes into its own as a
bludgeon against the other small warships likely to be
fielded by a peer star-faring polity.

Found only in rich, peaceful regions of space, the bulk
freighter is capable of hauling thousands of tons of
goods between star systems. While it’s equipped with
enough of a sting to discourage small-ship piracy, it’s
woefully inadequate to handle a warship, or even an
up-gunned free merchant.
Some adventurers do find use for a bulk freighter
hull, however, trading off some of its massive cargo
space for more fittings and using customized modifications to allow the ship to support heavier power
demands. While the end result is no match for a true
cruiser, the sheer mass of the freighter can make it a
dangerous opponent in the right hands.

The archetypal warship of post-Silence humanity, the
fleet cruiser is a ship-eating monster compared to its
smaller brethren in the navy. Only prosperous polities
can build such powerful ships, and even they sometimes find it more practical to have a flexible fleet of
small craft rather than a few heavily-armed cruisers.
The chief advantage of a fleet cruiser is in its heavily-armored hull. Only special hunter-killer ships fitted
with armor-piercing weaponry have any real chance of
penetrating the cruiser’s thick skin. Those weapons are
almost always more bulky and power-hungry than their
peer weapons, so enemy polities must usually choose
between building small ships that are very effective at
defeating other small ships, or building hunter-killers
that can threaten cruisers but are at a disadvantage
against their less specialized brethren.

Built off the biggest hull class that TL4 polities can

worlds with adequate resources to do so often balk at
expending such a tremendous amount of money on a
single ship.
Those that do build battleships do so for a reason.
The tremendous weight of fire these ships put out can
pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced
hull plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers often require hunter-killer
frigates to take them out, battleships commonly require
hunter-killer cruisers to disable them.
The main weakness of a battleship is the fact that it
is only a single ship… a single, extremely expensive ship.
It can only attack or defend a single location at a time,
and an enemy that has the time and resources to build
specialized anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and
expendable crews can bring the battleship down for far
less money than it cost to build it.

Building a Ship
A fortunate adventurer has won the favor of a powerful shipping magnate, and has earned one million
credits worth of astronautic work. The player thinks
it’s an excellent chance to have a ship built to fit the
adventuring party’s needs.
She starts by looking over the ship hulls and
quickly sees that a free merchant hull is the best she
can afford. A shuttle hull might work, but such a
ship is too fragile for her liking. The hull itself costs
500,000 credits and comes with a drive-1 spike drive.
It also has free Power and Mass scores of 10 and
15 respectively. The player can fill that space with
fittings and defenses as she wishes.
First, she looks at weaponry. She wants enough
firepower to discourage small ships, but she can’t
mount weapons that require a cruiser or capital hull,
and a plasma beam is far too expensive. She could
settle for a multifocal laser, which is cheap, but she
decides to up-gun to a fractal impact charge, trusting
in the party’s Warrior to aim it well. It costs 200k
credits, 5 power, 1 mass, and 1 free hardpoint. It can
store up to 8 charges in the launcher since a frigate-class hull is one larger than the minimum needed
to mount it. The charges themselves will cost her
another 4,000 credits.

Next, she thinks about better engines. She briefly considers a drive-3 upgrade, but it would take 4
points of Power and Mass, leaving her almost no
Power left for other fittings. She settles for a drive-2
upgrade for 100k credits, 2 Power, and 2 Mass.
She takes a moment to think about adding some
hardened polyceramic overlay to the merchant as a
defense, but the ship’s Armor is so low that it doesn’t
seem worth the effort to harden it.
The PCs will need to land, so she adds an atmospheric configuration at 50k and 2 Mass. She wants
fuel scoops so she doesn’t have to trust to local refueling stations, so that’s 50k, 2 Power, and 2 Mass. Prudence recommends a fuel bunker in case she needs
to drill out before refueling, adding 25k and 1 Mass.
She’s so far spent 929,000 credits, 9 Power, and
8 Mass. To spare bookkeeping, she puts in a ship’s
locker for 25k, but an armory is too expensive; the
PCs will just have to track their own weapons and
ammo. The remaining Mass is turned into 140 tons
of cargo space. Thus, the final ship costs 954,000
credits and uses 9 Power, and 15 Mass. At a rate of
25,000 credits of shipyard work a day, it’ll take the
yards about 39 days to build, giving the party time to
think about how they’ll pay for maintenance…

The queen of every navy that has one, a carrier is the
pinnacle of TL4 shipbuilding technology and a massive credit sink for any polity rich or desperate enough
to build one. Every fully-equipped carrier holds more
firepower than most modern navies can assemble, and
a single carrier is more than enough to crush most TL4
naval task forces.
The carrier itself is only the vector for its tremendous payload of ships, both small fighters and corvette-type daughter craft. The ability to quickly alter
the flight wings of a carrier allows a rich planet to tailor
its loadout to the specific needs of a campaign, whether it’s destroying the interstellar commerce and asteroid mines of an enemy polity or going head-to-head
against their cruiser line of battle. Many polities further
optimize their carrier-loaded ships by removing their
spike drives and replacing them with system drives, relying on the carrier to get them into position. Of course,
if the mothership is destroyed in hostile territory, these
orphans are doomed.
While a carrier has a belly full of death, the ship
itself is lightly gunned and has significantly weaker
armor than its battleship brethren. Any polity rich
enough to build a carrier knows well enough to equip
it with an escort of other ships to screen it from hostile attentions. Lightly-armed as it is, a wing of fighter-bombers can leave it a burning hulk if it’s caught out
without protection.

108• Modifying and Tuning Starships

Modifying and Tuning Starships
Most ships are maintained in the condition they came
from the shipyard, with the crew and the engineers
working to keep things aligned with the shipwright’s
specifications. Such rigid conformity with standard
techniques ensures easy repair, cheap maintenance, and
the ready ability to switch crews without requiring laborious retraining or familiarization. Not all engineers
value these qualities so highly, however, and some prefer to install their own improvements.
A ship’s engineer can alter the wiring, internal
structure, or other specifications of a starship, either
to improve overall performance or make tradeoffs that
are useful to their needs. Making these modifications
isn’t cheap, and they often require the strategic deployment of rare pretech ship components.
Engineers with sufficiently vast resources, shipyard access, and available pretech components can
completely re-engineer a ship to integrate their improvements in the basic hull structure. These improvements no longer require their special attention to keep
them operational, allowing the engineer to focus on
other modifications or allow less talented crewmen to
keep the ship in fighting trim.

Mods and Maintenance

Every engineer has a Maintenance score, the same used
for installing equipment mods as described on page 100.
The score is equal to their Intelligence modifier plus
their Constitution modifier plus three times their Fix
score. Any mod maintenance is counted against this
Maintenance score, whether for equipment or starships.
An engineer can maintain a number of mods at
once equal to their Maintenance score. If a ship mod
is neglected for one week of active use, it breaks down.
Any fittings or functions dependent on the mod also
become inoperable until a sufficiently skilled engineer
spends at least 8 hours repairing the mod, a process
which requires time but no significant additional parts.
Ships parked at a station or landing strip don’t count
as “active” for this purpose, so the ship’s engineer can
go off for a week’s adventure or shore leave without
returning to a broken-down starship.
More than one engineer can work to maintain a
ship’s modifications, provided the maintenance officer
has a Fix skill score as high as that needed to install the
mod in the first place. This also assumes that the chief
engineer and any assistants work together closely to
properly teach the structure and quirks of the modification. The difficulty of maintaining this close teamwork
and sourcing exotic parts to maintain a non-standard
modification is one reason why very few NPC ships
have mods. While they’re possible for elite craft and
idiosyncratic prototypes, most military ships or corporate traders have too much of a logistical burden to
support these odd alterations.

Installing Mods

Every starship mod requires a certain amount of refitting work and after-market parts, along with a potential need for one or more pretech components. These
pretech components are not normally for sale, and are
usually found only through salvage during adventuring or as rewards for favors performed for important
personages. While they vary in structure and appearance, for convenience’s sake it’s assumed that a given
component can serve in installing any mod.
Building the mod can be done at a rate of one day’s
work for the crew per 5,000 credits in mod cost, or
one day per 25,000 credits if a shipyard’s services are
available. Mods can also be torn out, a process taking
less than a day that reclaims any pretech components
used in their construction but wastes any credit investment in parts.
Mod installation does not require a full shipyard,
but it does assume the full crew of the ship is assisting
the engineer in stripping components, welding in new
fittings, and hauling heavy parts. A lone engineer can’t
make mods to anything larger than a frigate-class hull,
and that might take a week’s painstaking labor for every
5,000 credits of cost.

Redesigning Ships

An engineer with vast amounts of money, components,
and shipyard support can completely rebuild a ship hull
to include a mod as part of its basic structure, or redesign an existing hull schematic to include the mod.
This is much more expensive than a quick after-market
addition, but the mod becomes part of the basic ship
itself and requires no further Maintenance.
To rebuild a ship with a mod, the engineer must
spend five times the usual cost in credits and twice as
many pretech components as usually required by the
mod. A shipyard is mandatory for such extensive redesign, and can do the work at a rate of 25,000 credits
worth each day.
To build an entirely new hull that includes the mod
as part of its design, only the normal price of the mod
must be paid in credits and components. By integrating
the modification into the ship’s basic blueprints, the
engineer makes it much easier to install and maintain
it. Of course, the entire hull must then be built from
scratch at a shipyard, also at the usual rate of 25,000
credits of work done per day.
There’s a limit to the amount of flexibility an engineer has in such designs, however. A ship can only be
rebuilt or redesigned with a number of mods equal to
twice the engineer’s Fix skill score. Further mods can
be bolted on afterwards, but these will require Maintenance to keep in operating order, just as with any
other mod.

Modifying and Tuning Starships •109

Example Starship Mods

The following modifications aren’t the only alterations
that a canny engineer can install on a starship, but
they’re among the most common. Each one is listed
with the minimum Fix skill required to install or maintain the mod.
The credit price for most is expressed in a percent of the base hull cost; thus, to install a power trunk
streamlining mod with a 10% cost in a free merchant
hull would cost 50,000 credits, or 10% the cost of the
base hull. In a battleship hull, that same mod would
cost 6,000,000 credits.
The pretech component cost is given in components per hull class. Thus, if a mod requires one component per hull class, it would take one component for
a fighter-class hull, two for a frigate, three for a cruiser,
and four for a capital-class hull. These pretech components are usually rare and restricted enough that they
cannot be purchased on the open market. PCs need
to find them during their adventures, acquire them
through favors to powerful persons, or intentionally
seek them out in salvage adventures.
Most mods can be installed only once, though a
few of them labeled otherwise can be duplicated as far
as the ship’s infrastructure can support them.
Cargo Efficiency Bays (Fix-1): The ship’s internal structure is adjusted to optimize available cargo space.
The ship’s total free Mass is decreased by 10%,
rounded up, but, each point of Mass dedicated to
cargo space counts as two points. Cost: 10% of hull,
1 component/hull class
Compact Magazines (Fix-1): The ship can carry twice
as much ammunition as its available weapons and
magazine space would normally allow. Cost: 5%
of hull, no components
Drill Velocity Upgrade (Fix-2): The ship’s spike drive
is counted as one level better when determining
spike drill transit speed and maximum drill range,
up to a maximum of drive-6. Cost: 10% of hull, 1
component/hull class
Emergency Drill Activation (Fix-3): The ship can engage
its spike drives even when in dangerous proximity
to a planetary body. When engaged, it can drill out
in a single round. Doing so increases the difficulty
of any spike drive skill check by +2 if in-system or
+4 if actually landed. Drilling out from the surface
will destroy everything within 200 meters of the
ship. The mod can be used only once every four
weeks. Cost: 20% hull, 2 components/hull class
Emergency Thruster Boost (Fix-1): Retune the engines
for emergency power. Once per space combat,
gain a +2 bonus to Speed for three rounds. Cost:
10% of hull, no components
Engine Optimization (Fix-2): The engines have been
optimized for realspace maneuverability. The
ship’s Speed increases by 1. Cost: 10% of hull, 1
component/hull class

Eternal Reactor (Fix-2): The ship’s fuel tanks are replaced with effectively everlasting pretech energy
cores. It no longer needs to refuel for drills or operation. Cost: 5% of hull, 2 components/hull class
Extended Mass Support (Fix-1): The engineer trims back
the power core to allow for more ship mass. Lose
up to ten points of free Power; gain half as many
points of free Mass, rounded down. This mod can
be installed multiple times. Cost: 10% of hull, one
component
Low Emissions (Fix-1): Any sensor checks to detect the
ship have their difficulty increased by +2. Cost:
10% of hull, 1 component/hull class
Nemesis Tracker (Fix-3): The ship’s targeting computers are augmented with pretech prediction software. Once per ship combat, a gunner on the ship
can take an Instant action to cause a weapon shot
to hit, regardless of the hit roll. Cost: 5% of hull, 2
components/hull class
Oversized Mountings (Fix-2): Choose a specific weapon
or fitting that normally requires a hull size one
step larger than the ship the mod is installed on.
The ship can mount that fitting. Cost: 15% of hull,
1 component/hull size
Power Trunk Streamlining (Fix-1): Sacrifice free hull
space for superior power core efficiency. Lose up
to five points of free Mass; gain twice as many
points of free Power. This mod can be installed
multiple times. Cost: 10% of hull, one component
Q-Ship Cladding (Fix-1): Some or all of ship’s weapons
are concealed from external observation and standard scans when they are not deployed for combat.
The ship itself can be made to look like a merchant
or freighter of its size class. Cost: 5% of hull, no
components
Regenerative Armor (Fix-3): The ship’s Armor score
increases by 5 points. Cost: 15% of hull, 2 components/hull class
Reinforced Armor (Fix-1): The ship’s Armor score increases by the Fix skill of the installing engineer.
The ship loses one point of Power and one point
of Mass. Cost: 5% of hull
Specialized Mountings (Fix-1): Choose a specific weapon
or fitting when this mod is installed. The chosen
fitting requires only half the normal Power and
Mass per fitting installation, rounded down to a
minimum of 1. Cost: 10% of hull, no components
Volley Capacitors (Fix-2): The ship’s weaponry has been
altered for rapid firing. Once per combat, the
ship’s gunner gets 4 Command Points that must
be spent on gunnery actions. Cost: 10% of hull,
no components
Weapon Overcharge (Fix-2): One weapon of the engineer’s choice has been overcharged. It requires
50% more Power than a usual installation, but
rolls its damage twice and takes the better result
each time. This mod may be installed more than
once. Cost: 5% of hull, no components

110• Space Travel

Space Travel
Interstellar travel takes place through metadimensional
space, a higher-order continuum “understood” by only
a handful of brilliant researchers and astronautic engineers. Fortunately, it is not necessary to have an intuitive understanding of the place in order to operate
a spike drive starship. While modern postech spike
drives are neither as powerful nor as efficient as the
exquisite creations of the Terran Mandate, most TL4
worlds can still put together the necessary components
to get a ship from one stellar system to another.
Within the gravity well created by a stellar body, a
spike drive provides sub-light propulsion sufficient to
get the ship to most system locations within a few days
at most. Only at the edge of a solar system, where the
gravitic influence of the star dwindles away to almost
nothing, can the spike drive be fully engaged to catapult the ship into metadimensional space. This gravitic
transition zone is critical for providing the necessary
step-up and step-down for a spike drive. Without such
a transition, a ship can neither climb into metadimensional space nor come down from those elevated dimensional frequencies. Only a star is sufficient to provide enough of a gravitic gradient; random interstellar
rocks and debris don’t exert enough of an influence to
form a usable transition zone.
Ships are generally unable to “overshoot” a transition zone. If a ship is coming into a system from a spike
drive course to the stellar northwest of the star, it will
appear at the northwest edge of the solar system. Its
pilot can’t choose to “overshoot” that region, traveling
across the solar system to come down on the southeastern edge of the star’s transition zone. This property
allows a solar system’s owner to fortify probable transit
paths into the system, placing defenses and picket ships
in the path of likely arrivals.
This can be a difficult and expensive process if the
star is in a crowded stellar neighborhood. The transit
paths from each potential destination are different; if
a star has two other systems to its east, it has to fortify
two different arrival zones if it wants to be confident
of detecting incoming ships from both stars. If an exceptionally powerful spike drive allows an intruder to
drill in from a more-distant star, the local polity might
have no local sensors at all in the region, having never
anticipated that a ship might come directly from such
a distant location.
These relatively-fixed arrival zones only apply
to ships arriving at a star. A ship can leave from any
location on the rim, traveling toward any destination
within reach of its spike drive. Thus, a ship that’s able
to skulk past a system’s frontier sensors can usually find
an empty region of space in the transition zone to skip
out undetected. It also has no obligation to be on the
“correct side” of the star to go leaping off toward a particular stellar destination.

Making Spike Drills

Interstellar spike drills are dangerous. Some sectors
have the technology and friendly-enough metadimensional weather to make standard drill paths relatively
safe for travel. Ships in these favored sectors can move
between connected worlds with no significant chance
of disaster. Other sectors are not so fortunate, nor are
those ships that must forge through uncharted metadimensional space to reach their destination. Careless
navigation or sheer bad luck can result in these ships
being snuffed out by an unexpected surge of metadimensional energy or lost in the storms of hyperdimensional space.
To make a successful spike drill, the target system
must be within range. A spike drive has a hex range
equal to its rating; a drive-3 can reach a star three hexes
away on the sector map. Note that these sector maps
are abstractions rather than strict 2D maps. A star three
hexes away might be a vast distance away, but connected by a friendly stretch of metadimensional space. Conversely, an “empty” adjacent hex might have a star in
it, but it’s surrounded by killing waves of impenetrable
dimensional disruption. Because of this, conventional astronomical mapping isn’t overly useful to transit.
The astronomers might know that there’s a star only a
few light years away, but if the navigators can’t find a
metadimensional path to it, it might as well be on the
far side of the galaxy.
A spike drill requires one load of fuel. Most ships
can hold a single load of fuel at any one time. All can
be refueled from the appropriate refineries or starport
tending services, while others can use fuel scoop fittings to refuel from a star or gas giant. Other ships
have fuel bunkers that can hold more than one load of
fuel, for quick double-drills when speed is vital. Normal
intra-system maneuvering uses no significant amount
of fuel, and refueling costs a flat 500 credits per load.
A spike drill requires time. A safe drill procedure
requires half an hour to enter metadimensional space,
though this process can be rushed at greater risk. The
transit time is six days per hex traveled, divided by the
spike drill rating. Thus, a drive-3 crossing two hexes
would take four days, while a drive-1 moving to an
adjacent hex would take six days. Daring navigators
can “trim the course”, accepting greater risks in transit
in order to increase their effective drive rating by 1 for
purposes of determining the speed of travel, though
this bonus doesn’t increase the drive’s maximum range.
A spike drill needs a course record, or “rutter” to
guide the pilot. Ideally, this is an up-to-date and recent
record of the metadimensional currents and energetic
weather between the origin and destination of their
course, one reported by a recent traveler. The older and
staler the readings of the rutter, the more dangerous

Space Travel •111
the drill. Most rutters for commonly-traveled routes
are freely available, and significant trade corridors
usually have ones only a few days old available to any
pilot making the drill. Rutters charting heretofore-unknown paths between stars are often kept jealously secret by their owners, and may require an adventure or
a favor to obtain.
Attempting to drill to a star without any rutter
at all is insanely dangerous, the work of near-suicidal
crew of adventurers willing to risk everything in order
to obtain a secret route to some hopefully-unplundered
world. Only a masterful interstellar navigator has any
real hope of surviving such a blind drill.
Finally, a spike drill needs a pilot. Only a human
or other sentient-grade intellect is capable of dealing
with the dangerously unpredictable perils of metadimensional space, as expert systems and other “dumb”
robots simply can’t handle the random dangers. Most
ships require at least three crew members to cover all
the bridge watches necessary, though only one of these
crew needs to be an actual pilot. In desperate circumstances, a lone pilot can use drugs to stay awake for as
much as a week in order to single-handedly steer a ship
to its destination.
If all these ingredients are in place and the ship
is at the edge of the solar system, a ship’s navigator
can make an Int/Pilot skill check to make a successful
spike drill, the process taking 30 minutes. If rushed,
it takes only one ship combat round to execute. The
base difficulty is 7, modified by the available rutter, the
distance drilled, rushed procedures, and whether or not
the navigator is trimming the course to speed up the
transit. If the final difficulty is 6 or less, the drill is too
safe and simple to have any risk of failure.

Intra-System Travel

Traveling inside a solar system is much safer and more
rapid than interstellar travel. Barring unusual perils or
mechanical failure, such journeys can be made without
Pilot skill checks or risk of dramatic mishaps.
For convenience, space within a solar system is
broken up in regions. Each region is simply a place of
interest within the system; planets are regions, fortified
arrival zones are regions, particular pirate lairs in the
asteroid belts are regions, and so forth. Any particular
place of interest and its satellite areas can be treated as
a single region.
The base travel time for moving inside a region is
six hours. Thus, in six hours a ship could travel from a
planetary starport to a site on the planet’s moon, or to
a distant science station orbiting around the planet, or
to a distress beacon in space near that world. Any place
within that region can be reached within six hours, or
faster at the GM’s discretion.
The base travel time for moving between regions
is forty-eight hours. A ship in orbit around one planet
could thus travel to an entirely different planet, or to
the transition zone at the rim of the system, or to a
ship detected deep within system space, or to an asteroid pirate base, or to any other point of interest in the
solar system.
Base travel time is divided by the ship’s spike drive
rating. Thus, a ship with drive-3 could reach another
region in the system in only 16 hours. Bold navigators
can “trim the course” to increase their effective spike
drive rating by 1 by making a successful Pilot check at
difficulty 9. On a failure, the travel actually takes twice
as long as usual.

If the roll fails, something has gone wrong on
the drill, and a roll on the failed navigation results are
necessary. These mishaps don’t normally result in the
summary death of the crew, but they often force the
navigator to make emergency course changes or drill
exits that might leave the ship in a dangerously unfriendly region of space.

112• Sensors and Detection

Sensors and Detection
Adventurers often find it necessary to be very discreet
about their comings and goings within a solar system,
as do pirates, hostile warships, smugglers, and other
nefarious sorts. Space is wide and dark, and if a ship is
careful to avoid inhabited regions it can often escape
notice by a system’s inhabitants.

Hiding and Seeking

As a general matter it is very difficult to spot a ship in
deep space when it doesn’t wish to be spotted. Once a
ship’s energy signature is identified, however, it becomes much easier to follow the ship’s movement; such
a positional fix is called a detection lock, and once a ship
has been locked by an observer it can be tracked at any
distance in the system.
Fixing a lock on a target requires the observer to
be in the same region of space and to win an opposed
Int/Program skill check against the ship’s comms officer. If the observer wins the opposed roll, they get a
detection lock on the ship. If they lose or tie, they remain oblivious to the ship’s presence and can try again
in 24 hours. The active sensors used to form a detection
lock can be detected by the target; they know they’ve
been made. If the observing ship uses passive sensors,
the lock is undetectable, but it’s more difficult to obtain.
The observer takes bonuses and penalties to their
opposed skill check based on the circumstances as listed
below. This can alter their die roll substantially, and
make concealment almost impossible for ships not
specially equipped for stealth. The modifiers below are
common ones, but particular regions of space may have
their own hazards or complications, with some making
detection so difficult that they become favorite lairs for
pirates and malcontents.

The larger the ship, the better the sensors it will
have, but the easier it is to spot it in space. Minor outposts would reflect small deep-space habs or listening
posts, while major space stations would include most
military stations and other significant fortifications.
Ships that carefully avoid population centers when
landing on a world can mitigate some of the danger of
a planetary sensor network, leaving smugglers and pirates to prefer landing in remote, little-inhabited areas.

To break a lock, a tracked ship needs to leave the
region. As soon as it does, the observer and the ship
repeat their opposed skill check. If the observer wins,
it continues to track the ship, while a tie or loss means
the ship slips the lock. Any observers in the destination
region can attempt to pick up the ship immediately and
then once every 24 hours, but the original observer is
out of luck. Provided a ship is willing to escape to the
region of deep space above or below the solar ecliptic,
it’s extremely unlikely that there’ll be anything there to
spot them. Of course, such escape also means staying
clear of potential refuges. A ship that flees to the “edge
of the system” region can drill out to safety from there,
and unless they pick a chunk of the rim monitored
by the locals, they can do so with impunity. Very few
worlds can monitor the entire system perimeter.
When rolling for observation, only roll once for
any given group, outpost, or planet, using the best
modifiers available. Thus, if a battle squadron including a cruiser and three frigates rolls to observe, the
GM would use the skill bonus and +2 modifier for the
cruiser’s crew. If a separate pirate ship was in the same
region, the GM would roll for them as well, because
they’re a separate force in the region.

Pursuit and Escape

Adventurers have a habit of drawing unfriendly attention from hostile ships. While escape from a combat
engagement is a matter of maneuver jets and good piloting, long-range chases rely more on a ship’s spike
drives to provide raw motive power.
A pursuer must be in the same region of space to
pursue and must have a detection lock. Of course, if the
pursued lacks a detection lock on the pursuer, they’ll
have no idea that they’re being chased.
Both ships make Int/Pilot opposed skill checks,
each adding their spike drive rating to the roll. If the
pursuer wins or ties, they force an engagement and
the ships are moved into combat range. If the pursued
ship wins, it gets six hours of distance, modified by any
difference in spike drive ratings; a drive-1 ship being
chased by a drive-2 ship would have three hours, for
example. It can use this time to reach a particular point
inside the region, or can put it toward an attempt to
escape the region entirely. Ships with spike drive-1 engines need 48 hours to enter a new region, so they are
unlikely to avoid a determined pursuer; one with spike
drive-3, on the other hand, can make the escape in only
16 hours. Some pilots may attempt to speed this up by
trimming their course.
A pursuing ship can also use this six hours to aim
toward a different region, if it thinks it knows where
the ship is running. Assuming they can keep the detection lock when the pursued ship slips over the sub-stellar border, they can end up close on their prey’s heels.

Sensors and Detection •113

Scanning Planets and Ships

Short-range scans of ships and planetary objects are relatively simple affairs. Any scan of a ship within combat
range will reveal the ship’s hull type, obvious weaponry
and damage, and registered ID code. A scan of a planet
in orbit will always reveal basic information on atmosphere, geology, advanced energy-using surface communities, other ships in orbit, and any surface features
designed to attract orbital interest.
Comms officers can attempt to interrogate the
scans, asking one question before rolling an Int/Program skill check against difficulty 8. On a success, the
question is answered, while a failure means that the
data is inconclusive and no further questions can be
asked of it that day. Each question after the first success that same day is asked at a cumulative +1 difficulty
modifier. Questions should be simple and direct.
When scanning a ship, a comms officer might
ask whether particular fittings or weapons have been

Maintenance and Repair
Ships are expensive things to keep flying, and many
adventuring crews find themselves taking somewhat
dubious work just to get enough money to keep their
ship in the air.

Spares, Repairs and Refueling

Most ships have their repairs and maintenance done at
a shipyard, but a ship can perform field maintenance
and repair if they have the necessary parts. One ton of
cargo space can hold 10,000 credits worth of spare parts.
Any time required is quadrupled, however.
Ship fuel costs a flat 500 credits per load.

Six-Month Maintenance

Every ship needs to spend 5% of its total non-crew cost
every six months in order to pay for basic maintenance.
Each such period that is skipped applies a -1 penalty to
all ship skill checks and hit rolls. At -4, the ship gains a
10% chance per month of breaking down entirely until
backlogged maintenance is repaired. At a shipyard, this
maintenance takes a day for a fighter hull, a week for a
frigate or cruiser, and a month for a capital ship.

Repairing Hulls and Systems

Fixing ship hit points can be done at a cost of 1,000
credits per point, with up to the presiding engineer’s
Fix skill repaired in points each day. A disabled system can be jury-rigged back to functionality for onetenth the system’s cost and one day’s work per 25,000
credits so spent. A jury-rigged system that is disabled
again is destroyed. Full repairs of a disabled system cost
one-quarter of its original price.
Repairs made during combat do not need to be
re-done or paid for afterwards, as they were performed
before the damage could become critical and lasting.

mounted, where good boarding points might be on the
hull, whether the ship looks to be the product of a particular world or culture, or simply to question whether anything looks odd about the ship’s readings. The
sensors can probe a meter or so beneath the hull skin,
but they can’t intrude on a ship’s computer network or
provide a map of interior spaces.
When scanning a planet, a comms officer can ask
about apparent capitals or spaceports, major industrial
sites, unusual planetary weather patterns, unique allergens or atmospheric hazards, current local news transmissions, or identify hidden or low-tech communities
that are large but do not have clear energy signatures.
If they have the Survey Sensor Array fitting, they
can do orbital visual spying accurate enough to read
newsprint, in addition to asking questions about subterranean spaces, visible surface life forms of interest,
crude maps of the interior spaces, and interesting energy readings.

Sneaking In
The free merchant Grendel has just drilled into a
new system using charts her captain stole from an
unfortunate pirate.
As it happens, a small pirate base is positioned
in the region, placed there by its inhabitants to
keep an eye on any traffic from the adjacent system. They get a chance to detect the Grendel, and
roll the pirate comm officer’s skill bonus of +2 plus
another +2 for being a minor outpost, and a -2
for using passive sensors to avoid alerting targets.
Their total is 12. The Grendel’s comms officer is
good, however, and gets a +2 for being a frigate-class ship. His Int/Program skill roll is a 13,
meaning the base has not detected the ship.
Now the free merchant gets a chance to spot
the station, also using passive sensors at a -2 penalty. The outpost is a very visible space station, and
takes -2 on its opposed roll, while the frigate gains
a +1 on its check. The base rolls a 7 and the Grendel
rolls an 8. The frigate has a detection lock on the
pirate base.
Her captain decides to sneak further into the
system. She can’t be sure the station hasn’t spotted
her, but it’s made no obvious sign of it and she
wants to investigate the local planets and their inhabitants. The Grendel’s drive-2 engine can cross
over to a planet’s region with 24 hours of travel.
This will give the station one more chance
to lock the ship, since it can try again in 24 hours.
Even if it does successfully lock the free merchant,
however, the captain bets they can lose it when
they transfer out of the solar region. The pirate
base might broadcast an alert to any other local allies, however, which could make things awkward.

114• Space Combat

Space Combat
The clash of ships in the void, the flash of silent explosions and soundless death… these things are familiar to interstellar adventurers, and a natural hazard of
the profession. While most adventurers seek to avoid
such hull-melting conflagrations of war, sometimes the
choice is not their own. When two or more ships close
to combat range with the intent to kill, it’s time to fight.

The Combat Round

Space combat begins with a normal initiative roll, one
made by each ship involved in the combat. Each rolls
1d8 modified by the Intelligence or Dexterity modifier
of the pilot, and they take their turns in order, with
PCs winning ties. Once every ship has had a turn, the
round starts over from the top. Initiative is not rerolled.
A round of ship combat takes about 15 minutes, but
Experts and Warriors can only use their special class
abilities to reroll skill checks or ensure automatic hits
once per engagement.
On its turn, a ship’s captain decides in which order
its various departments will act: bridge, gunnery, engineering, comms, and captain. Each department then
chooses actions, choosing either from their specific
department or a general action available to all departments. A department head can choose actions from
only one category; they can’t pick from both. Some of
these actions generate Command Points, allowing other
departments to spend these points taking actions that
require them. When all departments have acted, the
next ship in order can go.
If the ship is an NPC ship, the GM can abbreviate the process, giving it a fixed number of Command
Points based on its general crew quality, with the ship
being able to take whatever actions it needs using that
total. Fighters and civilian ships usually have 4 Command Points, military or pirate ships have 5, native
spacers and highly-trained warships have 6, and the
finest NPC crews in space can muster 7 points.

Ship Departments

For purposes of interstellar combat, every ship is assumed to have five departments: bridge, gunnery, engineering, comms, and captain. A ship with too few
crew to actually man these departments may have to
double-up on staffing, but these five functions are the
ones that are critical during space combat, and every
ship has to be able to act on them.
The bridge is where the ship’s piloting and navigation is done. This might be no more than the cramped
cockpit of a starfighter or it might be a cavernous central control node in the bowels of a battleship. The
bridge department handles attempts to escape combat,
perform evasive maneuvers, or pursue a fleeing enemy.
The gunnery department is in charge of the ship’s
weaponry. If it’s used to blow pieces out of something

unfriendly, it’s in the charge of the gunners who man
this department. They’re the ones who fire a ship’s guns
and make the targeting calculations necessary to snipe
specific systems and weapons on a hostile target.
Engineering keeps the ship flying when enemies
are carving chunks out of her hull. They can perform
damage control, boost the engines to speed a ship’s maneuvers, and execute emergency repairs to get a damaged system back online before it’s too late.
The comms department doesn’t just handle inter-ship communications, but it also manages sensors,
electronic warfare, and combat hacking duties. Their
crew can baffle enemy targeting attempts, fool hostile
sensors, and choke enemy computers with ECM.
The captain is master of the ship and directs the
other departments. On a warship, this discipline might
be taut and automatic. On a ship piloted by PCs, obedience may be less certain. Regardless, the captain can
boost the effectiveness of other departments, direct
crew for perilous but necessary tasks, or convert otherwise-crippling hits into more manageable crises.
For player-run ships, every PC should be put in
charge of one of these departments, preferably the one
that best suits their character’s skills. If a PC is totally
incompetent for space combat, they can be given temporary control of the NPC officer who actually is in
charge of the department, and can run that NPC as
their character during the fight. If the ship is so small
that there is no NPC available to run the department,
then the PC is treated as a supernumerary officer, and
can only take actions from the general action list available to all departments.
Sometimes there are fewer PCs than there are departments. In that case, double-up the duties of two
or more departments on a single PC. That PC can
still only take actions from one departments per turn;
any departments they don’t take an action from are
assumed to use the Do Your Duty action, adding 1 Command Point to the ship’s available total. Thus, if a PC
was in charge of both the bridge and the comms, she
could take actions either from the bridge list, the comms list, or the general list of actions. If she didn’t pick
any action from the bridge or comms list, the neglected
department would simply use Do Your Duty to add +1
Command Point to the ship’s available total. For a single-seat fighter, the lone crewman might have all five
departments on his head. Such a pilot would be able to
take actions from any single department each round
with the other four providing 4 Command Points to
fuel that action.
Sometimes the PCs may want to swap departments in mid-battle for some reason, or to replace a
department head who has been incapacitated. They
may do so at the start of any given combat turn provided that the department heads involved do not object.

Space Combat •115

Actions and Command Points

At the start of every ship’s turn, the captain decides the
order in which the departments will take their action.
In the chaos of combat, she can give directions to the
heads, but they are not obligated to follow them.
When a department’s turn comes up, the PC in
charge chooses actions, either from their department
list or the general action list. Some actions may require skill checks to execute properly, while others are
automatically successful. Some actions may require
Command Points to be spent in order to attempt them,
while others give Command Points. A few prohibit the
PC from doing any other action that round.
Barring these actions, a department head can take
as many actions as they have Command Points to spend
on them. A gunnery chief with 4 Command Points, for
example, could use the Fire One Weapon action twice,
spending 2 Command Points each time, or he could
use the Fire All Guns action once, spending 3 Command
Points and leaving 1 left. The department head does not
need to get permission to spend points from the rest of
the crew; if he decides to burn the points to open fire
when the rest of the crew wanted him to save them,
that’s too bad for the rest of the crew. A traitorous or
uncooperative department head can only be stopped
by PC intervention with the Deal With a Crisis action.
After every department has acted, all excess Command Points are lost. Ships normally start their turns
with 0 Command Points.

Attacks and Damage

When a ship fires a weapon, it can choose any target
involved in the combat. Either the gunnery department
head, an NPC, or a nominated PC may make the attack,
but a given gunner can man only one gun a round. The
gunnery head is always the one to spend Command
Points to fire, but their nominees may be the ones actually manning the guns and rolling the attacks.
The gunner rolls a normal hit roll, using their
base attack bonus plus the better of their Intelligence
or Dexterity mods, plus their Shoot skill. If flying a
fighter-class ship, Pilot may be used in place of Shoot.
Foci that normally give bonuses to Shoot attacks, such
as Gunslinger, do not apply to ship combat unless specifically noted as doing so. The luck ability of the Warrior
class may be used once per fight to hit with ship guns,
but cannot be used to negate a hit against their ship.
If the hit roll equals or exceeds the target ship’s
Armor Class, the attack is a success and the attacker
may roll damage, again modified by the better of the
gunner’s Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers. This damage is lessened by the target’s Armor score, which may
in turn be negated by a gun’s Armor-Piercing quality.
A successful hit by a plasma beam, for example, does
3d6 damage plus the gunner’s attribute modifier, with
an Armor Piercing quality of 10. Against a free merchant with an Armor score of 2, the full damage of the
beam gets through, as the AP 10 cancels out all the
merchant’s Armor.

116• Space Combat
Armor can negate all damage from a hit if it’s
strong enough. If Armor completely negates the attack,
the hit cannot disable systems.
Sufficiently skilled gunners can use the Target System action to aim a shot at a particular weapon system,
engine, or other fitting that seems vulnerable to the
GM. On such a hit, the damage is halved, rounded up,
before Armor is applied. If any damage gets through,
that system is disabled and cannot be used until it is
repaired. Engines lose one drive rank instead, so that
a drive-2 spike drive becomes a drive-1 until repaired.
Disabled systems hit again or drives reduced below
drive-0 are destroyed, and cannot be repaired during
combat. A ship with destroyed engines cannot perform
any bridge actions and may be boarded at an attacking
ship’s leisure, assuming its guns are also disabled.
If a ship is reduced to zero hit points, fighter-class
hulls are instantly destroyed with all hands. Larger
ships are mortally damaged. Such crippled ships can
take no action and will explode within 2d6 minutes
unless the chief engineer succeeds in an Int/Fix skill
check against difficulty 10. On a failure, the explosion is
inevitable, while on a success the ship merely becomes
a burnt-out hulk with all systems destroyed. If sufficiently vast amounts of repair supplies are still intact in
the hold, a determined crew might be able to jury-rig
the maimed ship into temporary operation.

Ship Crises

Instead of accepting some particularly gruesome hit or
disabling attack, a PC ship can instead choose to accept
a Crisis. The attack or the disabling hit is then negated,
with no damage done. Instead, the GM rolls on the
Crisis table to find out what dire event happened as
a consequence of the hit, instead of the ship damage.
Some of these Crises are continuing. They will
continue to plague the ship until a PC can solve them
with the Deal With a Crisis general action. Usually this
involves a skill check at difficulty 10, but multiple PCs
can choose to take the Deal With a Crisis action to cooperate in resolving the problem that round.
Some of these Crises are acute. The PCs must resolve them before the end of the ship’s next turn or else
something very bad will happen.
A ship can accept only one Crisis per round, not
including the Into the Fire or Keep it Together captain
actions which may be taken at the captain’s discretion.
Thus, if the ship is hit twice, only one of those hits can
be converted into a Crisis unless the captain uses one
of these actions. A ship accepts a Crisis if any of the
department heads requests it, even if the rest of the
heads don’t want one. Thus, if the ship’s main gun is hit,
the gunnery chief can request a Crisis to prevent the hit
even if the rest of the crew was against it.
To simplify ship combat, NPC ships do not normally accept more than one Crisis per space combat,
at most. They usually just take the damage or negative
effects of hits straight until facing imminent ruin.

Handling Crises

To resolve a Crisis, a PC needs to take the Deal With
a Crisis general action on their department turn. They
must explain what they are doing to solve the problem
to the GM, who will then tell them what combination
of attribute and skill they should roll. The usual difficulty of resolving a crisis is 10, though the GM may
increase or decrease that difficulty by up to 2 points
either way depending on how bad the Crisis is and how
useful the PC’s plan is to resolve it.
If the PC succeeds in the roll, the Crisis is ended.
Continuing Crises no longer apply their penalty to the
ship, and acute Crises are defused before disaster can
strike. If they fail, a continuing Crisis is unchanged and
an acute one is yet unresolved.
More than one PC can try to resolve a Crisis, either
making an independent attempt if they have a relevant
skill, or using their talents to aid the main responder
with the usual rules for aiding another’s skill check.
The Deal With a Crisis general action can also be
used to get a scene’s worth of general activity aboard
the ship. If a xenomorphic monster suddenly breaches
the ship’s hull during a battle with its alien mothership,
two of the PCs might take the Deal With a Crisis action
to spend a scene battling the beast in the guts of the ship
while the rest of the party tries to keep the ship fighting.

Running a Crisis
When a Crisis hits a ship, the GM should describe
it in a concrete way. A Crew Lost crisis, for example,
may be described as “A damage control squad has
been trapped in the engine room and temperatures are rising dangerously high.” A Hull Breach
might be described as “That last hit drove a support column through a capacitor bank; it’s about
to explode.” It should be described as a specific
problem that threatens the ship.
In turn, when a PC chooses to Deal With a
Crisis, they should indicate what it is exactly that
they’re trying to do. A PC with Fix might declare
that they’re trying to pump coolant into the engine room, or a telekinetic PC might try to forcibly
eject the capacitor bank before it can explode.
Don’t worry about being too technically precise with descriptions, or painstakingly deciding
whether the ship has available coolant supplies
or whether the capacitor is one ton or two. Decide whether or not the plan the PC is declaring
is plausible or not in the general sense, and set the
difficulty accordingly.
Extremely good plans or applicable abilities
might make the Crisis resolution check as easy as
difficulty 8, while a very marginal plan that doesn’t
seem likely to help might be difficulty 12. Whatever you do, keep it quick; don’t drag it out in play.

Space Combat •117

Ship Combat Actions
Every PC can take one or more actions per ship round.
PCs who are department heads can pick actions from
their department. Any PC can pick from the general
actions. Some actions prohibit any other act that round.
Most actions have a cost in Command Points.
Usually, some PCs choose to Do Your Duty or go Above
and Beyond to generate Command Points, while others
then spend them on actions for their department. All
unspent Command Points are lost at the round’s end.
NPC ships usually have a base number of Command Points they can spend each round, and may pick
actions freely to spend them. For simplicity, NPC ships
can’t usually generate more Command Points with
their actions and can’t normally take Captain actions.

Bridge Actions

Escape Combat (4 CP): Roll an opposed Int/Pilot or Dex/
Pilot skill check plus your ship’s Speed against the
fastest opponent’s skill check plus their ship’s
Speed. On a win, all enemy ships gain one point
of Escape. If an enemy ship gets three points, after
three uses of this maneuver, your ship gets away
from that ship and is no longer in combat with it.
Evasive Maneuvers (2 CP): Roll Int or Dex/Pilot against
difficulty 9 to add your Pilot skill to the ship’s AC
until its next turn. Usable once per round at most.
Pursue Target (3 CP): Opposed Int/Pilot or Dex/Pilot
skill check plus Speed against the target ship’s skill
check plus Speed. On a win, you shed one point
of Escape rating the target ship may have on you.

Captain Actions

Into the Fire (0 CP): Accept a Crew Lost Crisis and gain
your Lead skill plus one in Command Points. You
may do this at most once per round.
Keep It Together (0 CP): Nullify a successful enemy hit
and roll a Crisis instead. You can use this action
in Instant response to an enemy hit but you may
only use it once per round.
Support Department (0 CP): Choose a department. One
action that department takes will require 2 fewer
Command Points. You can do this once per round.

Comms Actions

Crash Systems (2 CP): Roll an opposed Int/Program
check against a targeted ship. On a success, it starts
its next turn with a Command Point penalty equal
to your Program skill.
Defeat ECM (2 CP): Roll an opposed Int/Program
against a targeted ship. On a success, any attacks
this round by your ship against the target get a hit
bonus equal to twice your Program skill.
Sensor Ghost (2 CP): Succeed on a difficulty 9 Int/Program check to gain your Program as an AC bonus
until the next turn. Usable once per round at most.

Engineering Actions

Boost Engines (2 CP): Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty 8. On
a success, the ship’s Speed is increased by 2 until
the start of the ship’s next turn.
Damage Control (3 CP): Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty
7. On a success, repair a number of lost hit points
equal to your Fix skill times 2 for fighter hulls, 3
for frigates, 4 for cruisers, and 6 for capital-class
hulls. Each attempt of this action after the first in
a fight increases its difficulty by a cumulative +1.
Emergency Repairs (3 CP): Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty
8. On a success, a disabled system is repaired or
a damage-degraded drive has its rating increased
by 1. Destroyed systems cannot be fixed this way.

Gunnery Actions

Fire All Guns (3 CP): Gunners fire all weapons mounted
on the ship, designating targets as they wish.
Fire One Weapon (2 CP): A gunner fires a single ship’s
weapon of their choice.
Target Systems (1 CP): A Fire One Weapon action you
take this round may target a ship’s weapons, engine, or fittings the GM decides are vulnerable.
Such targeted attacks take -4 to hit. On a hit, do
half damage before applying Armor. If damage
gets through the system is disabled or drive is
degraded by 1 level. Disabled systems hit again
are destroyed. You may take this action more than
once to aim additional shots you may fire.

General Actions

All these general actions are exclusive; if you take one
of these actions you can do nothing else in the round,
either before or after you take the action.
Above and Beyond (0 CP): Push yourself to help the ship
or its crew. Pick an attribute and skill check and
explain how you’re using it to help the ship. If the
GM agrees, roll it against difficulty 9. On a success,
gain your skill level in Command Points plus one.
On a failure, take -1 Command Point.
Deal With a Crisis (0 CP): Explain what you are doing
to solve a Crisis and roll the relevant skill check.
The difficulty is usually 10, plus or minus 2 depending on the situation and the effectiveness of
your action. On a success, the Crisis is resolved.
You may also use this action to aid another PC in
resolving a Crisis, or to take one scene’s worth of
other actions around the ship.
Do Your Duty (0 CP): The ship gains 1 Command Point.
PCs who head more than one department can act
only in one of them; the rest automatically take
this action. If invoked by a PC, they must name
some plausible act the PC is doing to be useful, and
can’t do the same act two rounds in a row.

118• Space Combat

Ship Crises
Once per round, a ship may choose to accept a Crisis
instead of taking an enemy hit. They must choose to
do so immediately after damage is rolled, and only one
player needs to request the Crisis to get it even if the
rest of the party doesn’t want it. Once the Crisis is accepted, the hit is negated and the GM rolls on the table.
The captain may also choose to voluntarily accept
a Crisis through their Keep It Together or Into the Fire
department actions. Use of these actions doesn’t count
against the one-voluntary-Crisis-per-round maximum.
Some Crises are continuing. They will apply a
penalty to the ship that continues until some PC successfully performs a Deal With a Crisis action.
Other Crises are acute. They inflict no immediate
negative consequence, but if the PCs don’t resolve it
by the end of the next combat round, an unpleasant
consequence will ensue. The Crisis is then removed.
The same Crisis rolled more than once will stack
on the ship, though hits to empty cargo holds or dry
fuel tanks may not be much of a problem to the ship.

Dealing With a Crisis

Any PC can Deal With a Crisis by taking that general action and describing what they’re doing to solve
the problem. They then roll an applicable skill check
against difficulty 10, possibly modified by up to plus or
minus two depending on the GM’s judgment of their
general plan and its likelihood of being helpful. On a
success, the Crisis is resolved. All Crises are considered
resolved at the end of an engagement.

Crises

Armor Loss: The hit melted an important patch of ship
armor, cracked an internal support, or exposed a
sensitive system. Until resolved, the ship’s Armor
rating is halved, rounded down.
Cargo Loss: The hit has gored open a cargo bay, threatening to dump the hold or expose delicate contents to ruinous damage. If not resolved by the end
of the next round, lose d10*10% of the ship’s cargo.
Crew Lost: Brave crew risk their lives to keep damaged
systems operating. Describe the danger they face.
If the Crisis is not resolved by the end of the next
round, 10% of the ship’s maximum crew are incapacitated, not counting any Extended Life Support
fittings. Half these crewmen are dead or permanently disabled, and the other half return to duty
in a week. Extended Medbay fittings halve the number of dead and crippled. If the ship has run out
of NPC crew when it takes this Crisis, a random
PC must roll a Physical save; on a success, they
lose half their hit points, while on a failure, they
are mortally wounded. If not stabilized by the end
of the ship’s turn through some PC taking a Deal
With A Crisis action to heal them, they will die.

resolved, no bridge actions can be taken, though
the pilot can still perform general actions.
Fuel Bleed: The ship’s fuel tanks have been holed or
emergency vents have been force-triggered by
battle damage. If not resolved by the end of the
next round, the ship will jettison all fuel except the
minimal amount needed for in-system operation.
Haywire Systems: Critical command links have been
damaged or disordered by the hit. Until resolved,
the ship starts each round at -2 Command Points.
Multiple such Crises can stack this penalty, crippling a ship until the Crises are resolved.
Hull Breach: The hull has been damaged in a way that is
currently non-critical but is about to tear open an
important compartment or crumple on vital systems. If not resolved by the end of the next round,
the ship will take damage: 1d10 for fighter-class
hulls, 2d10 for frigates, 3d10 for cruisers, and 4d10
for capital hulls, all ignoring Armor.
System Damage: One of the ship’s systems has been
cooked by the hit. The GM randomly picks a
weapon, fitting, or engine; that system is disabled
as if hit with a targeted shot, with drives suffering
a 1 point drive level decrease. Disabled systems hit
by this Crisis or drives reduced below drive-0 are
destroyed and cannot be repaired during combat.
Target Decalibration: The gunnery computers are
hopelessly confused and cannot lock the ship’s
weaponry on a target until this Crisis is resolved.
VIP Imperiled: Shipboard damage threatens a random
PC or important NPC. That victim must immediately roll a Physical saving throw; on a success,
they lose half their hit points, and on a failure they
are mortally wounded. NPC crew can make a free
attempt to stabilize the downed VIP using their
usual NPC skill bonus. If the NPC fails, and no PC
takes a Deal With a Crisis action to successfully stabilize them by the end of the ship’s turn, they die.

Space Combat •119

The Thunder of the Guns
The free merchant Grendel finds herself engaging the
Sacred Wrath, a patrol boat of the Luminous Hegemony determined to stop the Grendel before it can
deliver its cargo of military supplies to the rebel outpost that contracted the ship. Captain Wilhelmina
Stokes knows she’s substantially outclassed by the
patrol boat, but she trusts her comrades and is determined to blast her way through.
The combat begins with an initiative roll. The
Grendel’s pilot rolls 1d8 plus the best of his Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers, getting a 6. The
Wrath’s pilot rolls a 4, so Grendel goes first.
Grendel starts her turn with 0 Command Points.
Captain Stokes decides that she’ll act first among the
crew, and uses the Support Department action to aid
the gunnery department; one action the gunner
takes will be 2 Command Points cheaper than usual.
The ship still has no Command Points, however, so Captain Stokes tells the comms chief to go
next. Feeling daring, the comms chief decides to go
Above and Beyond to help the ship, overclocking the
ship’s computing core. The GM decides this is an
Int/Program skill check, so the comms chief rolls it
against difficulty 9. He fails his first roll, but uses his
Expert class reroll benefit to try again, and gets it the
second time. The ship gains 3 Command Points for
the comms chief’s Program-2 skill.
Stokes considers letting the gunner blaze away
now, but she wants to go for a real torrent of fire to
open the fight, so she asks the bridge pilot to act next
to build more Command Points. He chooses to Do
Your Duty, adding 1 CP and declaring that he’s lining
the ship up for the shot.
Three Command Points aren’t enough for the
captain, so despite the gunner’s entreaties, she chooses for the engineer to go next. She also plays it safe,
deciding to Do Your Duty and feed power to the guns.
Lastly, there’s a sixth PC in the crew, a storyteller with absolutely no applicable space-faring skills.
Even though he is no department head, the captain
nominates him to act next, since every PC gets to act
each round. Able to take only general actions, the
storyteller chants a mighty lay of battle to encourage
his comrades on to glory. The GM lets him roll a
Cha/Perform skill check to go Above and Beyond, and
he succeeds, adding 3 more Command Points from
his Perform-2 skill.
Now, at last, with 8 Command Points, the captain gives the gunner her signal. The gunner decides
that it’s absolutely critical to defang the patrol boat
before it can open up with its plasma beam. He
chooses to Target Systems with his attack, spending
1 CP. He knows the free merchant’s sandcaster has
no chance of piercing the patrol boat’s armor, but
his multifocal laser can cut through the ship’s plat-

ing. Thus, instead of trying to fire the sandcaster this
round, he decides to blaze away exclusively with the
laser, using the Fire One Weapon action. Firing one
weapon costs 2 Command Points and he has 5 left,
plus the captain’s Support Department action to give
him a zero-cost shot.
The gunner is a grizzled Warrior and uses his
class ability to make the first shot an automatic hit.
He rolls 1d4 for damage, +1 for his Dexterity modifier, and gets a 3. The multifocal laser’s armor-piercing
quality of 20 overwhelms the patrol boat’s Armor
of 5, but since he’s Targeting Systems, his damage
is halved, rounded up. The patrol boat takes 2 hit
points of damage… but its plasma beam is now disabled until the boat’s crew can perform repairs.
The gunner’s not satisfied; he wants that gun
wrecked. He Fires One Weapon again for 2 CP, Targeting Systems once more for 1 CP, rolling a hit roll at
-4 and using his Shoot skill and Dexterity attribute to
modify his attack bonus. He hits with a 15 and does
another 2 damage, destroying the gun.
The GM decides that the patrol boat’s captain
is willing to go to extremes to prevent this, and lets
him accept a Crisis instead. The GM rolls 1d10 and
gets the Hull Breach crisis; if the boat can’t resolve
it by the end of the next round, it’ll take 2d10 hit
points of damage that ignores Armor, but for now
the gunner’s second hit is negated. The gunner has
2 CP left, so he burns those and his captain-supplied
free shot on two more attacks, both of which miss.
The round ends, and if the Grendel had any CP left it
would lose them now.
Being a properly-trained military crew, the
Sacred Wrath has 5 Command Points. Her captain
knows that her absolute priority is getting her gun
back online, so he spends 3 points to do Emergency
Repairs from the engineer actions. The GM rolls her
crew’s default +2 skill bonus and gets a 9, enough to
fix the plasma beam and remove its disabled status.
That leaves the NPC ship with 2 Command
Points left, which is just enough to open fire. The
gunner blasts away with the plasma beam, using his
hit bonus of +4 to get a 17, enough to hit the Grendel.
The plasma beam does 12 points of damage to the
free merchant, its AP 10 defeating the target’s Armor.
Captain Stokes can’t handle a hit like this and
immediately accepts a Crisis. The GM rolls an Armor
Loss result, halving the Grendel’s already-sad Armor.
The next round then begins. The PCs have the
edge, as the Wrath is going to need to Deal With a Crisis or take a heavy hit at round’s end. If the Grendel’s
gunner can’t shut down that plasma beam, however,
the free merchant runs the risk of eating more hits
than it can survive… or trying to evade those hits and
rolling a Crisis her crew can’t handle.

THE HISTORY OF SPACE
The default setting of Stars Without Number is a far
future age in which the sprawling, glorious domain
of human space has been reduced to a scattering of
squabbling powers and long-lost worlds. The ancient
domain of humanity has shrunken with the collapse
of the psi-powered Jump Gates that once stitched the
remote regions of the frontier into the teeming worlds
of the human core.
Now, almost six hundred years after the catastrophe that ended the Golden Age of Man, new hope rises
from the wreckage of a fallen empire.

In the Beginning

Humanity’s interstellar history began in a musty instafab laboratory on a remote coast in northern Greenland
in the year 2108. A small army of jury-rigged microfab
plants and hotwired autofacs had been churning for
years, painstakingly realizing the plans of their creator.
Dr. Tiberius Crohn was an insular lunatic of the first
water, a laughingstock among physicists and a regular
font of absurd claims. Were it not for his admitted talent at wrangling autofacs he would likely have vanished
into the twenty-second century’s faceless proletarian
mass without so much as a ripple.
His talents had gotten him the parts and resources
to establish his laboratory in the radioactive wilds of
Greenland, not far from the hot zone left by a missile
from the Russo-European War. The glow masked the
peculiar emissions from his test units, but in 2108 his
work finally reached fruition. Crohn had invented the
spike drive, the faster-than-light engine that would lift
humanity to the stars.
Even now, a thousand years later, researchers
still wonder how Crohn managed to devise the mathematics and theories that supported the spike drive’s
creation. Widespread claims of “alien influence” were
debunked by later Mandate historians, but rumors of
these “Mentors” are still stock space legends.
Some of the axioms involved defied all perceptible reality, and the theories made certain assumptions
about the fabric of the universe that spun off at least a
dozen new religions within the first two hundred years
of the discovery. The spike drive was a window on a
universe far stranger and vaster than experimenters
had thought possible.
Through a delicate gravitic twisting of the universal substrate beneath a ship, the spike drive drove
it “upward” through a spectrum of dimensional frequencies. The ship vanished from mundane, “luminal”
space and was thrust into the metadimensions. These
inchoate realms of vast energy currents and formless
masses were extremely hostile to unprepared ships,
but their gravitic currents propelled a ship at speeds
impossible in the mundane universe. Suitably massive
objects such as stars cast a “shadow” into these meta-

dimensions, forming both navigational beacons and
anchor-points that enabled transit up and down the
dimensional spectrum. So long as a spike drive had a
star to launch from and a star to bring it down, it could
ride the metadimensional currents in a headlong rush
of superluminal speed.
The initial transit along a course was always the
most dangerous. The metadimensional currents were
unmapped on those routes, and a navigator had to
make regular course corrections in hope of finding a
current that would bring them to their course before
the spike drive’s protective bubble broke down in the
metadimensional environment.
Once the initial journey had been made, course
rutters could be shared with other ships. So long as
ships regularly made the transit, any shifts in the currents could be recorded. If a route lay fallow for too
long, however, the slow creep of currents would render
the rutters worse than useless, and a fresh course would
need to be plotted by some brave crew.
Crohn’s discovery was announced by the sudden
launch of his retrofitted spacecraft-laboratory from the
Greenland hot zone. A number of orbital weapons platforms attempted to bring it down, but the spike drive
provided such a wildly anomalous maneuver profile
that the tracking algorithms were hopelessly confused.
Earthside watch stations followed him out to the edge
of the solar system, dutifully recording his ship’s impossible velocity. At the very rim of the system the sensors
picked up a strange gravitic surge, and he was gone.
He returned thirteen days later, broadcasting a radio transmission that not only included data on Alpha
Centauri that could only have been acquired through
on-site surveying, but also included the necessary data
for the reconstruction of the spike drive. Between the
observations of the tracking stations and the content
of the signal, there was no doubt of it; mad old Crohn
had actually done it.
Even today, no one is entirely certain how he managed it. A prototype spike drive would have required
six days of metadimensional travel to reach Alpha
Centauri and drill down into mundane space. Crohn
claimed to be alone aboard the ship, but such would
have required him to remain awake and navigating the
uncharted drill course for six straight days, all without
any hint of prior experience. The creed that later became known as the Book of the Sky refers to it as “the
Night Journey of the Prophet Tiberius” and considers
it the founding event of the faith.
Tiberius himself promptly drilled back out into
metaspace once his transmission had been sent. He was
never seen again. To this day, thirteen known religious
sects are convinced that he was translated directly into
the presence of God as a fitting reward to the opener
of the celestial ways.

122• The History of Space

The First Wave of Colonization

Exclusivity was impossible with this new discovery.
Overnight, every industrialized nation on Earth began
a frantic rush to build spike drive-equipped starships,
each nation fearing to be left behind in claiming the
stars above. Paradoxically, earthside tensions faded rapidly as the disposition of this spit of land or that patch
of oil seemed to be trivial compared to the wealth that
awaited in the sky.
Initial exploration revealed that the spike drives
had a maximum range before the corrosive effect of the
metadimensional environment fatally degraded their
protective bubbles of mundane space. It was necessary
to hop from star to star, reaching more distant stellar
bodies by progressive advance. In the course of these
explorations numerous exotic planetary bodies were
discovered. The first one habitable by human beings
was a barren mudball with an oxygen-rich atmosphere
discovered in 2113. Dubbed Renaissance by its Greater
European discoverers, it drove the other Terran nations outward in an even greater frenzy of exploratory
acquisitiveness.
Pan-Indian scouts discovered the first life-bearing
world in 2150. The primordial soup that covered the
water world of Pranashakti served as a research subject for a generation of xenobiologists. The excitement
was only heightened when an American survey craft
discovered the ancient alien ruins on the mist-shrouded moon called Typhon. Their creators had vanished
more than 40,000 years ago, but the scanty remains
showed evidence of a technologically sophisticated culture possessing a humanoid anatomy not wholly unlike
that of humankind.
This First Wave of colonization sent humanity in a
steadily expanding sphere from the green fields of Terra. By 2200, most habitable worlds within a year’s spike
drive travel had at least a handful of human inhabitants.
Numerous political and religious splinter groups took
to the heavens once asteroid mining brought the price
of a spike drive-equipped starship within the reach of a
large corporation. Humanity was growing beyond the
reach of its leaders.

Retrenchment and the Mandate

The governments of Terra grew increasingly concerned with their far-flung colonists. Even the fastest
spike drive courier couldn’t reach the Rim worlds in
less than four months, and projecting military force
at such a distance was beyond the power of all but the
strongest nations. Rather than let their colonists slip
entirely out of their control, the greater powers on
Terra agreed to form the Terran Mandate, an organization dedicated to policing human space and exerting
the authority of Terran governments over the far-flung
colony worlds.
Furthermore, expansion beyond the current Rim
worlds was forbidden. Splinter groups, cults, and microcultures were required to live within the pale and

were forbidden to colonize worlds of their own for
reasons of “social harmony” and “interstellar security”.
More than a few of these groups defied the new Mandate and sought worlds beyond their reach in the far
dark. Deprived of the usual sources of support, most
were never heard from again.
Even with these new limits, the Terran Mandate
was hard-pressed to contain the colonial worlds. There
was little in the way of actual fighting between the colonies, as few had the ships or manpower to spare, but
here and there the more zealous splinter groups or
dedicated ideologues could not bear to live in peace
with their neighbors. The Mandate kept a loose sort
of discipline over the Rim worlds but by the year 2260
direct control was tenuous at best.

MES and the Psionic Authority

It was during the peak of the First Wave, in 2240, that
the first instances of a frightening new syndrome appeared in the children of starship crew members. Perhaps one in ten thousand of these children would begin to exhibit strange and inexplicable powers. Some
time around puberty, abilities manifested that ranged
from an intuitive vision of the immediate future, to
inexplicable mind-reading, to powers of superluminal
teleportation. Children who exercised these abilities
invariably suffered progressive and permanent neural
damage leading either to death or permanent insanity.
A dozen uses, two dozen… sooner or later the damage
overwhelmed the victim. Only by completely avoiding
use of these powers could a child’s mind be saved.
Dubbed “Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome”, or “MES” by researchers, these subjects were
gathered for extensive testing and examination. Parents were told that the children would be taught ways
of controlling and suppressing their abilities, but most
modern researchers believe that some among the
children were used as guinea pigs in terrible experiments meant to quantify this new power. Whatever
the means, the investigators soon learned that “Messes”
were actually serving as living channels for waves of
metadimensional energy.
The power was shaped and focused by the wielder’s neural pathways. Mere meat was never meant to
endure the kind of energies that boiled through a Mess,
and neural pathways were left scorched or burnt out
entirely by use of the powers. Every test was destructive. The only question was whether repeated use of the
powers would kill the Mess’ body first or take their sanity. Researchers also discovered that once the energies
had finally burnt out a victim’s mind, the charred brain
pathways were effectively immune to further damage.
An insane Mess, or “feral” could use their powers with
impunity, and usually did.
It wasn’t until 2275 that these shadowy researches
finally bore fruit. The damage to a Mess’s mind could
not be avoided, but by individualized programs of
meditation, focus, and mental training, the damage

The History of Space •123
could be routed through less critical areas of the brain.
A properly-trained “psychic”, as they were now called,
could use their powers extensively before the charge
threatened to overflow their existing channels and they
were required to rest and recuperate.
Formulating these programs of study required a
trained psychic mentor to shape the basic curriculum
into the correct sequence of meditations for a given
pupil. Despite the best efforts of researchers, it proved
impossible to impart this education through recorded means of instruction. A living, psychically-active
metapsion tutor properly educated in the training protocols was mandatory in teaching new psychics.
In an attempt to control the provision of psychic
mentors, the Terran Mandate inaugurated the Psionic
Authority. The PA grew to be a quiet but pervasive
organization throughout human space, taking young
MES sufferers into its care for training. The rarity of
MES left psychics largely as figures of mystery and no
little fear to less gifted humans. Psychics could often
make vast sums of money with their powers, but many
worlds established sharp restrictions on psychic activities… and then often employed government-sponsored
psychics who could ignore the strictures.

First Contacts

As these changes rippled through human culture, the
species found itself no longer alone in the cosmos. The
steady expansion of human space discovered more than
empty ruins on several habitable worlds. The Young
Races such as the Kont and Ualub were found inhabiting their ancestral worlds, diligently building their
way towards Bronze Age technologies. Some species
seemed to be the decaying remnants of a former empire,
such as the handful of used-up worlds that housed the
weary race of Mettau and their cities of dancing glass.
These Elder Races had all had their time in the sun, tens
or hundreds of thousands of years ago, only to fall prey
to internecine strife, vainglorious experimentation, or
sheer cultural ennui.
Some of these alien races were strong and vigorous
still, though usually fresh from their own technological
youth. A few short, sharp border wars usually settled
matters in humanity’s favor, and even those wars that
were not so successfully prosecuted lost mankind only a
few worlds within easy reach of their rivals. More often,
these races formed uneasy trade pacts with humanity,
exchanging examples of strange alien technology and
art for the science of human worlds.
The majority of sentient alien species that humanity discovered shared roughly similar humanoid dimensions. Called “the Like” by xenobiologists, controversy
still bubbles over the seeming prevalence of humanoid
form among alien races. Some scientists suggest that
the humanoid shape is simply the one most suitable to
the expression of sentience. Others find this explanation too simplistic, and believe that humanoid shapes
are simply most suitable to the kind of human-habit-

able biomes that draw the most interest from human
explorers. Further exploration might reveal legions
of supercondensed life forms in the core of gas giant
worlds, or flocks of hydrogen-based webs floating in
the darkness between stars.
Some species owe nothing to human form. These
Others are alien in a way that no oxygen-breather could
possibly be. Some are composed of silicon or alien earth
compounds, such as the “lithomorphs” and their planetoid-ships. Others are congeries of spherical atmosphere-bubbles, or sentient interference-patterns set
up in the oceans of an ammonia-covered liquid world.
The Others are almost invariably too different in mind
and needs for humans to communicate with them.
Their acts of violence are inexplicable and seemingly
random, and their purposes defy human comprehension. Psychics who attempt to contact the mind of an
Other risk their sanity under waves of awareness utterly unlike the thoughts of a fleshly brain.

Pretech, Psitech, and the Gates

Psionic Authority researchers had not halted their
study of MES energies after their initial training breakthroughs. Official histories credit the discoveries to the
courage of a few psychics willing to conduct destructive,
dangerous experiments on their own minds. Legends
speak more of criminal psychics and bewildered young
Messes “encouraged” to cooperate in experiments that
eventually claimed their sanity or their lives.
Whatever the source of the data, the Psionic Authority was able to formulate new techniques of psychic
power. These abilities were usually very subtle and esoteric, microscopic adjustments of ambient universal
constants that allowed for the manufacture of materials and products that were simply impossible to create
with technology bound to the mundane world’s laws.
Atoms and molecules danced to the will of these fabricator psychics, and new wonders were born from the
factories of humanity.
The introduction of psychic fabrication marked
the development of “pretech”, the high science and artifice of the Golden Age of Man. Pretech artifacts were
marvelous works, most of them performing some miracle of energy manipulation or material science. Pretech spike drives doubled the maximum reach of a drill
course, and pretech drugs and biotech gave humankind
several centuries of hale good health before age might
claim them.
The greatest accomplishment of pretech, however,
was in the development of “psitech”, a complex melding
of psychofabricated pretech components and psionically-active materials. Psitech devices could channel and
amplify a psychic’s abilities to a remarkable degree. Psitech was never common, given the rarity of psychics
themselves, but it found regular employment in pretech manufactories.
The greatest accomplishment of psitech, in turn,
was the development of the Jump Gates. These mas-

124• The History of Space
sive rings of psitech resonators floated at the far rim
of a solar system, wide enough to receive the slowboat
freighters that lumbered out from planetary orbits.
With the help of a choir of master psychic teleporters,
these ships would be hurled for scores of light years
across the galaxy, emerging from a Jump Gate held
in waiting at their destination point. The weeks or
months of spike drive travel that would otherwise be
required were compressed into a few days.
The Jump Gates quickly replaced spike drive travel throughout the core regions of human space. The
only check on their expansion was finding the necessary number of master teleporters to power them,
and the great expense of shipping components out to
more distant worlds unable to fabricate them on-site.
By 2450, almost all core and Rim worlds were served by
Jump Gates. The ease and cheapness of mass interstellar
transport caused some worlds to specialize as agricultural planets and other worlds to rely on interstellar
food imports.
By 2600, spike drives were antiquated technology,
found almost exclusively along the frontier of human
space where Jump Gates were too expensive and economies too primitive to justify their use.

The Second Wave

By then, the Second Wave of human colonization had
reached its peak. The development of the Jump Gates
had allowed the Terran Mandate to project its military strength far more easily, and the prohibitions on
expansion had been loosened. By 2600, the frontier of
human space extended almost ten years of spike drive
travel away from Terra. Even after taking Jump Gates
as far as possible, a fast pretech courier ship required a
year to reach the farthest colonial worlds.
The Jump Gates allowed for massive numbers of
colonists to flee the stultifying bonds of stratified Terran society. Over four billion people left Terra over the
course of the Second Wave, most of them sent gladly
by governments that were more than willing to dispose
of their more troublesome subjects. It wasn’t until late
in the Second Wave that the Terran Mandate began
to realize that it simply didn’t have the manpower
necessary to police the colonial worlds. Even with the
overwhelming technological advantage of Terran fleets,
there were simply too many colonies and too many
colonists to maintain direct control.
The colonies realized this as well, starting around
2450. There was rarely an explicit rebellion against
the Mandate; most often it was a disobedience of slow
decay, with tax shipments becoming intermittent and
then absent, and Mandate orders obeyed first slowly
and then not at all. The Mandate fleet struck a few of
the most valuable recalcitrants, but it was a rear-guard
action. The Terran Mandate had grown itself beyond
its ability to maintain control.
In the wild void of the frontier, spike drive armadas and petty stellar kingdoms formed to settle ancient

arguments between ideologies, religions, and simple
differences of ambition. Maltech research began to
take root on more isolated worlds, with forbidden
research into unbraked AIs, replicant nanotech, and
weapons of planetary destruction. Some worlds began
to experiment with human genomic modification beyond anything that convention had permitted. These
eugenics cultists sought the wholesale improvement
of the human genetic legacy despite the terrible costs
in maladaptive mutation and instability. Forces of the
Terran Mandate’s Perimeter agency tried to contain
these researches, but often were simply too few and
too poorly supported to do more than report on events.
The Golden Age of Man was already strained by
the pressures of these squabbling worlds and a Mandate
grown senile. Its deathblow was yet to come.

The Scream and the Silence

In 2665 a massive wave of metadimensional energy washed over human space. Spike drive craft in
metaspace were annihilated instantly, and in the blink
of an eye, every psychic in human space immediately suffered the consequences of catastrophic psychic
burnout. The majority died instantly, with the handful
that remained raving in the grip of incurable madness.
Later reconstruction placed the origin of this
“Scream” somewhere in the Veil Nebula, but no records exist of any successful investigation. Too much
collapsed too quickly for any sort of exploratory expedition to be sent. Humanity was suddenly stripped of
every psychic resource. Without living mentors, new
generations of psychics could not be trained without
recreating the entire laborious research corpus of the
now-erased Psionic Authority. It would take generations to mold functional mentors out of the untrained
mass of native psychics.
There was no time to recreate the necessary training. The Jump Gates were dead, and the core worlds of
human space collapsed with them. Countless colonies
that relied on the bulk produce of agricultural worlds
were left starving within months, their shipyards overrun by the desperate and ruined in the convulsive fighting over the few remaining spike drive ships. There
was no possible way to feed a world of millions with
the limited freight capacity of spike drive ships; only
the Jump Gates and their massive slowboat freighters
could move such masses of cargo, and the slowboats
were too big to be retrofitted with spike drives… even
if they could cross the stars quickly enough to make a
difference, which they could not.
Echoes of the disaster rippled outward. The frontier regions were still too poor and primitive to afford
Jump Gates, so the worlds that remained on the edge
of human space were forced to supply their own population with food and other necessities. Some of these
worlds relied on small shipments of vital supplies from
the core worlds. These luckless planets died when their
motherworlds perished. Others were more self-reliant,

The History of Space •125
but few of these had the necessary resources to build
spike drive ships of their own. Those few worlds that
were able to construct the ships struggled as their psitech became useless and their shipments of vital core
world components stopped.
Human space had collapsed into a welter of isolated worlds. Interstellar travel fell to the handful of spike
drive ships that could be kept running on scavenged
components and half-derelict spaceyards. The Silence
had begun.

The Silence Ends

For almost six hundred years, humanity has been slowly recovering from the consequences of the Scream.
Many frontier worlds have collapsed into barbarism
and balkanized warfare. These “lost worlds” have sufficient resources for agriculture and life, but lack the fossil fuels or radioactives necessary to bootstrap modern
technology. Some have even forgotten their origins or
have had them obscured in the haze of legend and myth.
Other worlds have been more fortunate. These
planets have been lucky enough to have the resources
necessary to sustain a rough and ready level of technology. Their fusion plants are bulkier than the pretech that existed before the Scream, their spike drive
engines are slower and more unstable, and the medical
technology is working well if it can give the population even a hundred years of good health before death
claims them. Still, these worlds have managed to devise methods for doing without the esoteric disciplines
of the psychic fabricators and are slowly ramping up
their production of spike drive ships as their techniques
improve. This “postech” may be inferior, but after the
Silence it can be replicated in a way that pretech cannot.
A few worlds have even managed to rediscover
the basic techniques of psychic mentorship. The fabulously subtle and sophisticated disciplines necessary

for recreating the old pretech manufactories are still
long-lost, but these new academies are at least able to
teach their students how to channel their powers in relatively safe and useful ways. Some worlds guard these
secrets jealously, but others make substantial profit out
of training foreign psychics sent by neighboring worlds.
A few academies operate without any governmental
supervision at all, willingly teaching their secrets to
anyone with the money or a compatible ideology.
Stellar domains have begun to form around the
most powerful worlds. Projecting more than a few tens
of thousands of troops to a neighboring world is far
beyond the abilities of most planets, so these domains
tend to be loose confederacies of like-minded worlds, or
else sparsely-populated colonies held under the ruthless
control of a vastly larger and more powerful neighbor.
Most of these domains are held together by a glue of
ideology and trade benefits, and border skirmishes are
becoming more common between rival space empires.
The alien neighbors of humanity have not been
idle during the Silence. The Scream appears to have
affected psychically-active races as badly as the humans
were wounded, but those species that were not so vulnerable have expanded into human space at several
points on the frontier. Some have even gone so far as
to seize human worlds for their own. In a few unfortunate regions of human space, entire sectors have been
conquered by alien powers.
Now, in the year 3200, the fragile web of interstellar commerce and exploration has been reformed.
Countless worlds remain locked in the darkness of
the Silence, awaiting the bold merchants or reckless
explorers willing to return them to the embrace of interstellar humanity. And if these brave souls should be
rewarded with the ancient wealth in salvage and data
so long trapped on these worlds, who is to say that they
do not deserve it?

126• The History of Space

A Timeline of the Future
2108: The spike drive is discovered by crank scientist Dr.
Tiberius Crohn. Humanity moves almost overnight from a handful of science stations on the
solar system’s inner worlds to all-out interstellar
exploration. Numerous Terran governments seek
the resources of new worlds.
2110: Several scout craft are lost while learning the limits of the spike drive. The dangers of excessive
frequency climbing are recorded by survivors.
2113: The first habitable extrasolar world is discovered
by the scout ship Magellan. The ship’s patrons
promptly claim the world for Greater Europe and
name it Renaissance.
2120: Pranashakti, the first life-bearing alien world, is
discovered by a Pan-Indian scout ship. The organisms consist solely of plant analogues and some
primitive marine life, but a generation of xenobiologists finds work in analyzing it all.
2130: The development of asteroid mining technology
provides vast amounts of raw materials to Earth’s
orbital shipyards and factories. Ship prices plunge,
and numerous smaller organizations and states become capable of stellar exploration.
2150: The ruins of an advanced alien species are discovered on Typhon, an otherwise unremarkable gas
giant moon. Archaeologists date the ruins to approximately 40,000 BCE. Dubbed “the Watchers”
for the eye-like circular motifs on the ruins, few
details are learned about the species.
2200: The First Wave of human expansion reaches its
peak. Most habitable planets within a year’s travel
time from Earth have been successfully colonized,
many by small religious or ideological groups.
Terran nations begin to forbid further exploration for fear of being unable to maintain control
over their offworld colonies over such distances.
The Terran Mandate is organized by Earth’s superpowers in order to ensure that Terran control
of the colonies continues.
2240: “Metadimensional Extroversion Syn­drome” begins to manifest in certain fifth-generation spacers.
Occurring most often around puberty, the abilities
exhibited by MES victims seem flatly impossible
by normal scientific measure: telepathy, teleportation, precognitive flashes, and other abilities that
defy understanding. The syndrome is inevitably
fatal unless the victim avoids all use of their uncanny abilities.
2260: Some colony worlds begin to grow restive, and
there are incidents of skirmishing and piracy on
the frontier. Few disputes are over resources, but
ideological and religious conflicts become more
common. The Terran Mandate struggles to deal
with the twelve-month message delay between
Earth and the farthest colony worlds.

2275: Researchers on several deep-space colonies begin
to develop methods for controlling the advance
of MES, allowing its victims to use their abilities without inflicting permanent brain damage
on themselves. The lives lost in this research are
never fully numbered, but Terran governments
rapidly move to control the research and training
under the aegis of the “Psionic Authority”.
2280: Properly-trained MES carriers, known commonly as “psychics”,or more casually, as “Messes”, begin to use their abilities to assist governments and
private enterprise. Numerous fields begin to benefit from the assistance of MES subjects, ranging
from telepathic mental health providers to precognitive industrial managers. The Psionic Authority begins to experiment with more focused,
industrially-useful psionic disciplines. Again, the
cost in lives is undisclosed.
2315: The Psionic Authority perfects the first jump gate.
A massive ring of psitech placed at the periphery
of the solar system, the gate employs a choir of
over fifty master teleporters to instantly translate
ships to a matching gate at Renaissance. Gate dispersal is slowed by a lack of master teleporters, but
eventually the transit time between Earth and the
frontier is reduced to two days. The Earth nations
lift the ban on further exploration now that their
effective control is enhanced.
2330: The Second Wave of human colonization begins.
Spike drive ships become all but unknown within
the core worlds as the jump gates allow cheaper
system ships to travel between the older colonies.
2350: Psitech-enhanced manufactory abilities and precognitive surveyors vastly increase the rate of viable colonization. Almost two billion humans leave
Earth for the wealth and freedom of the colony
worlds. The Terran Mandate begins to realize that
they now lack the manpower necessary to maintain control over so many colonies, even with the
reduced transit time.
2400: Obedience to Terran governments is now a polite
fiction on the frontier, in those cases when it is
acknowledged at all. The first stellar unions begin
to form. Some neighboring worlds resort to war,
but most colonists see no need for fighting with
so many unexploited resources.
2425: The Terran Mandate has become deeply corrupt
and hopelessly decadent. Its Directors concern
themselves exclusively with their own interests,
rivalries, and ideological obsessions. Only the AI
Maestros of Earth act as a check on their actions,
as the Directors are unable to effectively control
the Mandate without the help of their AI adjuncts.
These AIs struggle to maintain a basic level of probity among their creators.

The History of Space •127
2450: The Second Wave is at its peak; it is the Golden Age of Man. The Terran Mandate has largely
given up on exerting control over the frontier colonies, and now concentrates simply on neutralizing threats to the core worlds. Every description
of human civilization and ideology can be found
somewhere in human space, and cultures experiment with new forms of social organization. Psitech supplements normal technology to produce
enormous abundance for even the poorest worlds
with access to core technology.
2460: Human gengineering becomes common on some
worlds as societies attempt to improve their members. Advances in longevity and health spread
widely, but attempts to significantly improve human capabilities invariably bring serious drawbacks from system strain and unanticipated side
effects. Still, some of the more zealous cultures are
willing to accept these consequences in pursuit of
the “perfect human”.
2500: Jump Gates begin to reach the frontier. Major
systems are the first to receive them, while most
of the minor worlds are still reliant on spike drive
ships. The furthest reaches of the frontier now
extend ten years of spike drive travel from Earth.
Population growth levels off and begins to decline
with the increasing wealth of the colonies and
their progressive self-absorption.
2550: Certain remote sectors of space have begun to
embrace both gengineering and advanced AI
integration to recreate humanity in ways more
suitable to local ambitions. Some of these sectors
continue to interact with their baseline human
neighbors, while other transhumans are dangerously aggressive in their proselytization.
2600: Spike drive ships are now somewhat antiquated,
serving a vastly reduced exploratory effort and as
militia ships for the defense of local systems. Almost all core systems of importance are now linked
with jump gates. Psitech has permeated even very
basic technology on these worlds. Large-scale war
between worlds is almost unknown.
2665: The Scream erupts from somewhere within the
Veil Nebula. Reconstructions of the event suggest
that it was some form of faster-than-light psychic
emanation, the wave propagating from one end of
human space to the other within seventeen minutes. The Scream inevitably rendered a psychic
either dead or hopelessly insane. The Jump Gate
network collapses. A period of stellar isolation and
chaos begins, now commonly called “the Silence”.
2665: On Earth, the maddened arch-psions known as
the Crazed annihilate the planet’s infrastructure,
destroy many AI Maestros, and pervert the Highshine nanite recovery system. The solar system’s
defense grid is activated and made universally
hostile to all starships. Earth vanishes from all
surviving records, its present condition unknown.

2700: Countless core worlds die as they are cut off from
vital food and technical supplies. Psitech manufactories are crippled, and only a relative handful
of spike drive ships can be fabricated before the
industrial base erodes. These ships band together
for security while searching for resupply and become the progenitors of today’s Scavenger Fleets.
2705: Frontier worlds fare better than core planets.
More spike drive ships are available, and those
worlds that have yet to receive Jump Gates were
still devoting effort to autonomous agriculture
and industry. Even so, the sudden loss of every
human psychic leaves their psitech equipment and
industries largely useless. Many frontier worlds
devolve to survival-level subsistence.
2710: The last easily-salvaged remnants of Mandate pretech begin to wear out or become used up. The
most useful or effective tech was often explicitly
designed to be irreplaceable by frontier worlds in
order to maintain the Mandate core’s monopoly
on the technology. With the core worlds dead or
consumed by struggle, this technology can now
be found only in lost caches and Mandate ruins.
Some worlds go to desperate extremes to maintain
vital pretech infrastructure, utilizing dangerous
methods or unstable repurposed tech.
2900: Attempts are made to recover the techniques of
psychic training. The complete absence of any experienced psychic trainers hampers this effort, and
the cost in psychic lives to recreate this training is
enormous. A few worlds are successful in developing crude training programs, but most societies
abandon the effort in the face of more immediate
planetary needs.
3050: The Silence starts to lift. Those worlds that did
not experience a terminal collapse after the Scream
finally begin to perfect techniques of large-scale
manufacturing that do not rely on psitech. Even
the most sophisticated training programs can no
longer replicate the narrow and esoteric talents of
pre-Silence psychic fabricators.
3100: Spike drive ships begin the remapping of drill
courses between stars. With almost five centuries
of neglect, the pre-Silence rutters have become
useless. The steady shifting of dimensional layers
has rendered old course soundings dangerously
inaccurate. All of the drill courses must be rediscovered through trial and potentially fatal error.
Few Scavenger Fleets cooperate in sharing their
course data due to fears of competition.
3150: Stellar unions start to form around the strongest
worlds. Exploration continues, often in the hands
of small traders and scout crews who are willing
to risk all for the chance to open a route to an unplundered tomb world. Warfare erupts between
unions contesting control over lost worlds and
space installations.
3200: The present day.

SECTOR CREATION
Every self-respecting sci-fi game needs to be able to
provide a stock of interesting alien worlds. Even if a
campaign should happen to take place largely on a single world, the backdrop of foreign spheres adds context
and additional adventure hooks to the game.
Most campaigns are going to involve substantial
world-hopping, however, and the GM needs to be
ready to deal with this. This chapter will give you the
tools you need to fashion a sector of the void that will
be worth the reckless daring of a band of heroic PCs.

The Nature of Sectors

In the former days of the Mandate, human space was
generally divided into administrative sectors, each one
the particular responsibility of some fragment of the
ancient Terran bureaucracy. By the end of the Second
Wave, these responsibilities were almost entirely fictitious, as the Mandate Fleet lacked the manpower necessary to exert Old Earth’s will on its scattered progeny.
Even so, the centuries-old grind of bureaucratic procedure still dutifully labeled each fragment of distant
space with its own identity.
Sectors were established on the basis of metadimensional proximity rather than simple spatial propinquity. Individual stars in a sector might be spread
out over dozens of light years, but the metadimensional
currents between them were strong enough to allow
quick travel among them, when a physically-neighboring star might require impossibly lengthy drills through
metadimensional space to reach it.
Settlers in these far sectors often adopted Mandate
sector nomenclature simply out of convenience. The
sectors that Fleet scout ships and far trader adventurers
mapped out were composed of stars “close” enough to
allow for trade with their ramshackle spike drives and
colonial cargo haulers, and their density allowed for
trade and assistance between nearby friendly worlds.
Those with a more isolationist bent sought out sectors
with far-scattered stars that couldn’t be bridged by the
less sophisticated drives that most colonists used.
Most sectors had limited contact with other regions of space. While “bordering” stars could sometimes allow drills into a neighboring sector, large
patches of unfriendly metadimensional space often
strictly limited the available paths into or out of a sector.
Some sectors were entirely inaccessible by anything but
top-grade Mandate spike drives capable of leaping the
broad gaps around them, and some entire regions were
isolated by a few narrow bridgepoints into the cluster.
As a consequence, modern human space varies
wildly in every respect. Some regions have sophisticated interstellar trade and wide-reaching empires, while
others are struggling to rise from primitive barbarism.
A lost bridgepoint can separate whole empires, leaving
both entirely ignorant of each other… for the moment.

Sectors In Your Game

From a campaign perspective, sectors limit the scope
of material you need to take into account in your game.
While it’s perfectly possible to run a game with multiple interconnected sectors, the sheer bulk of worlds can
make that a painful prospect for most GMs. A single
sector of 21-30 worlds is more than enough for most
parties to explore.
Sectors and interstellar regions also provide you
with a convenient explanation for running dramatically different campaigns. Players who want to run a
space-operatic game set in a region of easy spaceflight
and consistent high-tech marvels can do so, while a
group that wants a harder sci-fi experience in a sector
without psionic powers or exotic energy weapons can
have their play as well. The vast sweep of human space
has room for your preferred tropes without having to
fight the setting. No matter what you want to play,
there’s some chunk of human space that has it.
A sector provides the basic background for the adventures the PCs encounter, as every world needs to
have some kind of adventure-worthy content if it’s to
justify its drain on a GM’s creativity and focus. Creating worlds purely for pleasure or aesthetic satisfaction
is entirely valid, but as a working GM, you also need
material you can play. This chapter will show you how
to maximize the return on your effort, and get the most
playable content out of the least amount of work.
This is a necessity in any system, but it is especially important if you’re going to be running a sandbox
game. A GM who tries to flesh out every nook and
cranny of the dozens of worlds they create will be rapidly exhausted by the effort, and might still lack the
content they need to actually run a game during the
next session of play. A GM needs to have a plan and
an appropriate set of tools if they are to deal with the
challenge in a comfortable, straightforward way.
When building a sector, you can generally assume
that it’s isolated from any neighboring regions. There
might be a few connections along the “borders” of the
sector, still-remembered spike drive paths into the next
collection of worlds, but you’ve got enough to build if
you just focus on a single sector at a time.
You are advised to carefully read the following
pages and take heed of the advice on how much content you should create for each world. A GM would
not be a GM if they did not take pleasure in creating
wondrous new worlds to explore, but the most enthusiastic demiurge still has a limited amount of creative
energy, time, and focus to spend on a campaign. If you
follow the steps in the following pages, you’ll be able to
ensure a playable amount of gaming content for your
next session before you start spending your effort on
more decorative elements of your creation.

130• Sector Creation

Creating a Stellar Sector
Once you’ve decided to forge your own piece of the
infinite void, you’ll want to grab a sheet of large-hex
hex paper from one of the many templates available online. First you’ll make a stellar map of the sector on this
sheet, and then you’ll individually flesh out the worlds
to whatever degree of fineness your needs require.
One crucial thing to remember at this stage of
creation is that you do not have to create everything. You
don’t need to answer every question about the sector or
have every world in adventure-ready condition. Right
now you’re just laying down broad strokes and rough
colors to the sector, and when it comes time to do detail
work you’ll save it for the worlds that matter most to
your immediate needs.
Every GM has a limited supply of time, energy,
and creative inspiration. If you try to fabricate an entire complete sector in one go, with interesting planets
and meaningful interstellar intrigue and easy adventure
hooks all over the place, you’re likely to exhaust yourself before you even get to play.
Instead, you should follow a simple guiding principle whenever building anything for your campaign,
whether a stellar sector or an adventure outline.
Am I having fun? If you’re enjoying yourself, then
you can keep building. We follow this hobby because
it’s fun, and if you’re enjoying the process then you
should let yourself have your indulgence.
Am I going to need this for the next session? If what
you’re creating is something you know you’re going to
need for the next game session, then you should finish
it. Don’t let this feeling of obligation extend to every
detail, however; it can be easy to imagine situations
where you’ll need to elaborate some NPC or organization or location, but if you respond to every such possibility you’ll never get away from the drawing board.
If you’re not having fun and you don’t need it for
your next game session, stop it. You’re going to exhaust
yourself on minutiae and trivia and not have the energy
to do the parts you really do need, or the vigor needed
to actually run this for the group.
With that principle kept firmly in mind, it’s time
to start building the sector.

Place the Stars

The standard sector map is a grid of hexagons 8 wide by
10 high, with hex templates easily acquired from the net.
Roll 1d10 and add 20 to determine the total number of
stars in the sector, or simply choose a number that suits.
For the first twenty or so stars, roll 1d8 and 1d10
together to determine the column and row in which
to place the star. If the hex is already occupied, place it
adjacent in the direction of the nearest edge.
Some columns have “half-hexes” in them, and only
9 full hexes; if you roll a 10 for such a column, either
reroll or place it at the bottom-most full hex.

Once you’ve placed the randomly-positioned
stars, add the remainder to connect any stellar clumps
or groupings. Remember that standard postech spike
drives can’t reach more than 3 hexes, so any cluster that
can’t be reached with such a drill will be inaccessible to
anything but pretech-grade drives.
The stellar map you’ve just created is an abstraction, one reflecting the eddies and currents of metadimensional space. The individual stars might look
adjacent on the map, but some may be vast distances
apart. If you’d prefer to use more realistic star maps,
you can grab some three-dimensional star map off the
web and convert a convenient number of light years
into a single “hex” of distance for spike drive purposes.

Lay Down the Primary Worlds

With the stars placed, it’s time to place the primary
inhabited worlds. While it’s possible to declare that
a star is orbited only by barren rocks, such stars are
more difficult to make useful as places of adventure
and gameable fun.
Right now, assume that each inhabited system has
a single primary world. The original colonists would
have naturally sought out the best, most habitable
world for their founding. As a consequence, however
nasty the primary world is, the others in the system
are probably even worse. If you wish to add additional
planets to the system later, you can do so, but for now
you’ll want to focus on just one.
Start by rolling two world tags for each planet.
World tags are simple tropes that reflect the most important qualities about the world, or at least those qualities most important to adventurers. A list of a hundred
potential world tags starts on page 132.
It’s most convenient to roll world tags for each
planet before moving on to the other elements of the
world, so you spend less time flipping back and forth
between the sections. Don’t worry about making the
tags make sense yet. Just note them down and go on.
Next, roll the atmospheres for each world. In this
and the following steps, you can either reroll results
that make no sense in light of the world tags you’ve
generated, or simply pick a result that fits. If you’re
feeling more adventurous, however, you can try to
think of an explanation that reconciles seemingly incommensurate results.
After you roll atmospheres for each planet, repeat
the process for temperature, biosphere, population,
and tech level. Optionally, you can go on to add additional planets or points of interest to each system.
Finally, tack on a name for the planet and give it a
sentence worth of description. You don’t need to flesh
it out fully right now. Just note down whatever rough
idea of it comes to mind from its world tags, population,
and other planetary qualities.

Sector Creation •131

Mark Polities and Trade Routes

Identify the star systems that are in contact with each
other and draw lines of communication between them.
Remember that any gap of 4 or more hexes can’t be
crossed without pretech spike drives, so any contact
between distant clusters will have to be through an
intermediate world.
Worlds in contact with each other may not necessarily be friendly, but they do know about each other
and have at least a basic understanding of local conditions. Some provision is usually made for foreign
visitors from these other worlds, even if it’s nothing
more than a strictly-monitored starport housing unit.
If two or more planets seem like they ought to
belong to the same interstellar polity, sketch out a “border” around the grouping. Most TL4 worlds would be
very hard-pressed to mount an effective interstellar
invasion of a peer world, so these polities have likely
formed out of diplomatic or cultural ties, or consist of
a local hegemon exerting its rule over planets too weak
or primitive to resist their influence.
Many sectors will have no multi-system governments of any kind. The individual worlds might be too
independent, or the recovery of spaceflight technology
may have been too recent to allow for ties of mutual
governance to form yet. Such disjointed sectors can
make life easier for the typical band of PCs, as escape
into a new system means escape from the legal jurisdiction of a world they may have recently offended.

Build Out the Important Worlds

Most of the worlds in your sector don’t need anything
more than what you’ve already given them. A few
worlds need more elaborate detail, however, and for
these you’ll want to make use of a separate planetary
record sheet for the world.
Only detail worlds that you’re going to need for
the next session. In this case, that means you should
detail the world that the campaign starts on and those
worlds that the PCs might end up traveling to at the
end of the first session. For most purposes, this just
means the starting world and its immediate neighbors.
First, pick a rough cultural template for the world.
Maybe it has a Latin American flavor, or was founded
by Russian colonists, or was an outpost of Byzantine
Empire enthusiasts. This culture has doubtless changed
drastically since its initial founding, but it gives you a
baseline for assigning names to people and places, identifying the common language spoken on the planet, and
giving you enough information to describe local foods,
architectural styles, and small slice-of-life elements.
You can always take the time to create an entirely
new hybrid culture, but whatever you make or choose
should be clear enough in your mind to let you give
quick answers to sudden questions about cultural values or local habits. Again, it’s not critical to worry about
historical accuracy; these worlds have had centuries to
form their own worldviews and local customs.

Next, use the world tags to create adventure components. Each tag includes different example Enemies,
Friends, Complications, Things, and Places. Take an
Enemy from both world tags or create one for each, and
merge them together into a single antagonist. Thus, a
Feral World with Heavy Industry might have a cannibal
oligarch who literally lives on the flesh and blood of his
slave laborers. Give this Enemy a name and a sentence
of description.
Repeat the process for a Friend, a Complication,
a Thing, and a Place. You don’t necessarily need to use
both tags in every instance, and you’ll likely want to
make up your own components inspired by the tags,
but you should have at least one item in each category
written down on the planetary record. You’ll use these
raw elements later to create a starting adventure for
your band of star-faring freebooters.
Lastly, take a few minutes to answer some critical
questions about the planet, noting the answers down
in the cultural section of the sheet.
What does this world have that the PCs might care
about? Does it export a valuable and portable commodity, or provide a special tech, or have unique job opportunities for expendable offworlder adventurers?
What is the biggest conflict on the world right
now? Is it a social struggle between classes, tension
with offworlder merchants or visitors, a war going on
among local governments, or some other big crisis?
Every world should have at least one obvious conflict
that the PCs might choose to engage or be pulled into.
What do they think about outsiders? Are they
comfortable with offworlders, do they view them with
unusual mistrust, or are they outright xenophobic?
What is law enforcement like? Are there special
laws that might tangle the PCs? If the PCs break a law,
what kind of enforcement can they expect?
Where do the PCs land? What’s the name of the
major starport on the world, and does the starport have
any special deficiencies or unique opportunities?
You can flesh out a world beyond these questions
if you wish, but they provide a bare minimum of data.

Choose Factions and Relations

Lastly, look at what you’ve created and determine
the relationships between the starting world and its
neighbors. Also, decide on the relationships between
any polities you’ve established. Open interstellar warfare is very hard for a lone TL4 world to sustain, but
a powerful planet or combine might be able to do it.
More likely are cold wars of spies and saboteurs.
You may decide to establish one or more Factions
to help give some independent motion to the sector’s
background. Two or three Factions are plenty for the
start of a campaign, and you should feel free to make
new ones or let old ones fall inactive as the game progresses. Rules for Factions start on page 210.
And with that, your sector is ready for play. The
Adventure Creation chapter gives the next step.

132• World Tags

Assigning World Tags
The first step in world creation, and perhaps the most
important, lies in assigning “tags” to the world. Tags
are brief conceptual tropes that set the world off from
planets of otherwise similar population and characteristics. You can either pick from the tag table to select
qualities that sound interesting for a world, or else roll
percentile dice to select them randomly.
In general, you should pick or roll two tags for
any given world. Using a single tag can leave a planet feeling somewhat flat and one-dimensional, while
using three or more can end up muddying the feel of
the world. The goal of the tags is not to automatically combine into some intricately sophisticated world
model, but to provide some clear, bright elements to
relate to the PCs. Tags can randomly give you “desert
planet torn by civil war”, from which you can then create “an arid world riven by factional disputes between
fragmented clans, the families based around ownership
of irreplaceable pre-Scream moisture collectors”.
Tags are meant to simplify your life as a GM. They
provide quick, simple hooks for adventure and cultural
characterization to help distinguish the myriad worlds
of your campaign from each other.

Tag

Each tag includes associated entries for Enemies,
Friends, Complications, Things, and Places that fit with
that tag. GMs can combine the elements of the two
tags to create ones flavored specifically for that world.
For example, two random tags for a world might be
“Regional Hegemon” and “Psionics Fear”. Combining
the “Colonial Official” and “Mental Purity Investigator” entries from the enemies lists of those tags, we
come up with Heinrich Stalt, Imperial Mind Proctor,
a grim inquisitor dispatched to the worlds under Imperial “protection” to purge them of the awful curse of
psionically-active monsters.
These NPCs, objects, places, and situations can
be used as raw grist for generating your adventures or
be slotted into the scenario seeds provided later in the
Adventure Generation chapter. Of course, not every
Enemy will be intrinsically hostile to the PCs, nor every
Friend necessarily a sympathetic figure.
Naturally, you should feel free to come up with
your own tags as well. Almost any science-fiction trope
that you enjoy can be turned into a tag, and characteristic elements can be blended into the list of raw
adventure components.

Abandoned Colony

Alien Ruins

The world once hosted a colony, whether human or
otherwise, until some crisis or natural disaster drove
the inhabitants away or killed them off. The colony
might have been mercantile in nature, an expedition
to extract valuable local resources, or it might have
been a reclusive cabal of zealots. The remains of the
colony are usually in ruins, and might still be dangerous from the aftermath of whatever destroyed it
in the first place.

The world has significant alien ruins present. The
locals may or may not permit others to investigate
the ruins, and may make it difficult to remove any
objects of value without substantial payment. Any
surviving ruins with worthwhile salvage almost certainly have some defense or hazard to explain their
unplundered state.

Altered Humanity

Anarchists

The humans on this world are visibly and drastically different from normal humanity. They may have
additional limbs, new sensory organs, or other significant changes. Were these from ancestral eugenic
manipulation, strange stellar mutations, or from an
environmental toxin unique to this world?

Rather than being an incidental anarchy of struggling
tribes and warring factions, this world actually has a
functional society with no centralized authority. Authority might be hyper-localized to extended families,
specific religious parishes, or voluntary associations.
Some force is preventing an outside group or internal
malcontents from coalescing into a power capable of
imposing its rule on the locals; this force might be an
ancient pretech defense system, a benevolent military
AI, or the sheer obscurity and isolation of the culture.

Anthropomorphs

Area 51

The locals were originally human, but at some point
became anthropomorphic, either as an ancient furry
colony, a group of animal-worshiping sectarians, or
gengineers who just happened to find animal elements most convenient for surviving on the world.
Depending on the skill of the original gengineers,
their feral forms may or may not work as well as their
original human bodies, or may come with drawbacks
inherited from their animal elements.

The world’s government is fully aware of their local
stellar neighbors, but the common populace has no
idea about it- and the government means to keep
it that way. Trade with government officials in remote locations is possible, but any attempt to clue the
commoners in on the truth will be met with lethal
reprisals.

Badlands World

Battleground

Whatever the original climate and atmosphere type,
something horrible happened to this world. Biological, chemical, or nanotechnical weaponry has
reduced it to a wretched hellscape. Some local life
might still be able to survive on its blasted surface,
usually at some dire cost in health or humanity.

The world is a battleground for two or more outside
powers. They may be interstellar rivals, or groups
operating out of orbitals or other system bodies.
Something about the planet is valuable enough for
them to fight over, but the natives are too weak to be
anything but animate obstacles to the fight.

Bubble Cities

The natives have extremely close bonds with the local
fauna, possibly having special means of communication and control through tech or gengineering. Local
animal life plays a major role in their society, industry, or warfare, and new kinds of beasts may be bred
to suit their purposes.

Whether due to a lack of atmosphere or an uninhabitable climate, the world’s cities exist within domes or
pressurized buildings. In such sealed environments,
techniques of surveillance and control can grow baroque and extreme.

Cheap Life

Civil War

Human life is near-worthless on this world. Ubiquitous cloning, local conditions that ensure early death,
a culture that reveres murder, or a social structure
that utterly discounts the value of most human lives
ensures that death is the likely outcome for any action that irritates someone consequential.

The world is currently torn between at least two opposing factions, all of which claim legitimacy. The
war may be the result of a successful rebel uprising
against tyranny, or it might just be the result of
schemers who plan to be the new masters once the
revolution is complete.

Cultural Power

Cybercommunists

The world is a considerable cultural power in the
sector, producing music, art, philosophy, or some
similar intangible that their neighbors find irresistibly attractive. Other worlds might have a profound
degree of cultural cachet as the inheritor of some
venerable artistic tradition.

On this world communism actually works, thanks
to pretech computing devices and greater or lesser
amounts of psychic precognition. Central planning
nodes direct all production and employment on the
world. Citizens in good standing have access to ample
amounts of material goods for all needs and many
wants. Instead of strife over wealth, conflicts erupt
over political controls, cultural precepts, or control
over the planning nodes. Many cybercommunist
worlds show a considerable bias toward the private

the local conditions.

The world regularly suffers some apocalyptic catastrophe that wipes out organized civilization on it.

The world is doomed, and the locals may or may not

though a few might struggle to find some way to
reverse their slow yet inevitable doom.

have experienced total moral and cultural collapse.
Whatever remains has been twisted beyond recognition into assorted death cults, xenophobic fanaticism,

are almost invariably quarantined by other planets.

Perhaps the world is a gas giant, or plagued with unendurable storms at lower levels of the atmosphere.

Great Work

Hatred

The locals are obsessed with completing a massive
project, one that has consumed them for generations. It might be the completion of a functioning
spaceyard, a massive solar power array, a network of
terraforming engines, or the universal conversion of
their neighbors to their own faith. The purpose of
their entire civilization is to progress and some day
complete the work.

For whatever reason, this world’s populace has a
burning hatred for the inhabitants of a neighboring
system. Perhaps this world was colonized by exiles, or
there was a recent interstellar war, or ideas of racial
or religious superiority have fanned the hatred. Regardless of the cause, the locals view their neighbor

Heavy Industry

Heavy Mining

With interstellar transport so limited in the bulk it
can move, worlds have to be largely self-sufficient
in industry. Some worlds are more sufficient than
others, however, and this planet has a thriving manufacturing sector capable of producing large amounts
of goods appropriate to its tech level. The locals may
enjoy a correspondingly higher lifestyle, or the products might be devoted towards vast projects for the
aggrandizement of the rulers.

This world has large stocks of valuable minerals,
usually necessary for local industry, life support, or
refinement into loads small enough to export offworld. Major mining efforts are necessary to extract
the minerals, and many natives work in the industry.

Hivemind

Holy War

Natives of this world exist in a kind of mental gestalt,
sharing thoughts and partaking of a single identity.
Powerful pretech, exotic psionics, alien influence, or
some other cause has left the world sharing one identity. Individual members may have greater or lesser
degrees of effective coordination with the whole.

A savage holy war is raging on this world, either between factions of locals or as a united effort against
the pagans of some neighboring world. This war
might involve a conventional religion, or it might be
the result of a branding campaign, political ideology,
artistic movement, or any other cause that people use
as a substitute for traditional religion.

Hostile Space

Perhaps the life is xenoallergenic, forcing filter masks

native predators are huge and fearless, or the toxic
flora ruthlessly outcompetes earth crops.

Immortals

Local Specialty

Natives of this world are effectively immortal. They
may have been gengineered for tremendous lifespans,
or have found some local anagathic, or be cyborg life
forms, or be so totally convinced of reincarnation
that death is a cultural irrelevance. Any immortality
technique is likely applicable only to them, or else
it’s apt to be a massive draw to outside imperialists.

The world may be sophisticated or barely capable of
steam engines, but either way it produces something
rare and precious to the wider galaxy. It might be
some pharmaceutical extract produced by a secret
recipe, a remarkably popular cultural product, or
even gengineered humans uniquely suited for certain work.

Local Tech

Major Spaceyard

The locals can create a particular example of extremely high tech, possibly even something that exceeds pretech standards. They may use unique local
resources to do so, or have stumbled on a narrow
scientific breakthrough, or still have a functional experimental manufactory.

Most worlds of tech level 4 or greater have the necessary tech and orbital facilities to build spike drives
and starships. This world is blessed with a major
spaceyard facility, either inherited from before the
Silence or painstakingly constructed in more recent
decades. It can build even capital-class hulls, and do
so more quickly and cheaply than its neighbors.

Mandarinate

Mandate Base

The planet is ruled by an intellectual elite chosen via
ostensibly neutral examinations or tests. The values
this system selects for may or may not have anything
to do with actual practical leadership skills, and the
examinations may be more or less corruptible.

The Terran Mandate retained its control over this
world for much longer than usual, and the world
may still consider itself a true inheritor of Mandate
legitimacy. Most of these worlds have or had superior
technology, but they may still labor under the burden
of ancient restrictive tech or monitoring systems designed to prevent them from rebelling.

Maneaters

Megacorps

The locals are cannibals, either out of necessity or out
of cultural preference. Some worlds may actually eat
human flesh, while others simply require the rendering of humans into important chemicals or pharmaceutical compounds, perhaps to prolong the lives of
ghoul overlords. This cannibalism plays a major role
in their society.

The world is dominated by classic cyberpunk-esque
megacorporations, each one far more important than
the vestigial national remnants that encompass them.
These megacorps are usually locked in a cold war,
trading and dealing with each other even as they try
to strike in deniable ways. An over-council of corporations usually acts to bring into line any that get
excessively overt in their activities.

Mercenaries

Minimal Contact

The world is either famous for its mercenary bands
or it is plagued by countless groups of condottieri
in service to whatever magnate can afford to pay or
bribe them adequately.

The locals refuse most contact with offworlders.
Only a small, quarantined treaty port is provided for
offworld trade, and ships can expect an exhaustive
search for contraband. Local governments may be
trying to keep the very existence of interstellar trade
a secret from their populations, or they may simply
consider offworlders too dangerous or repugnant to
be allowed among the population.

Misandry/Misogyny

Night World

The culture on this world holds a particular gender in
contempt. Members of that gender are not permitted
positions of formal power, and may be restricted in
their movements and activities. Some worlds may
go so far as to scorn both traditional genders, using
gengineering techniques to hybridize or alter conventional human biology.

The world is plunged into eternal darkness. The
only life on this planet derives its energy from other
sources, such as geothermal heat, extremely volatile
chemical reactions in the planet’s soil, or light in a
non-visible spectrum. Most flora and fauna is voraciously eager to consume other life.

Nomads

Oceanic World

Most of the natives of this world are nomadic, usually
following a traditional cycle of movement through
the lands they possess. Promises of rich plunder or
local environmental perils can force these groups to
strike out against neighbors. Other groups are forced
to move constantly due to unpredictable dangers that
crop up on the planet.

The world is entirely or almost entirely covered with
liquid water. Habitations might be floating cities, or
might cling precariously to the few rocky atolls jutting up from the waves, or are planted as bubbles on
promontories deep beneath the stormy surface. Survival depends on aquaculture. Planets with inedible
alien life rely on gengineered Terran sea crops.

Out of Contact

Outpost World

The natives have been entirely out of contact with
the greater galaxy for centuries or longer. Perhaps
the original colonists were seeking to hide from the
rest of the universe, or the Silence destroyed any
means of communication. It may have been so long
that human origins on other worlds have regressed
into a topic for legends. The players might be on the
first offworld ship to land since the First Wave of
colonization a thousand years ago.

The world is only a tiny outpost of human habitation
planted by an offworld corporation or government.
Perhaps the staff is there to serve as a refueling and
repair stop for passing ships, or to oversee an automated mining and refinery complex. They might
be there to study ancient ruins, or simply serve as
a listening and monitoring post for traffic through
the system. The outpost is likely well-equipped with

Perimeter Agency

Pilgrimage Site

Before the Silence, the Perimeter was a Terran-sponsored organization charged with rooting out use of
maltech, technology banned in human space as too
dangerous for use or experimentation. Unbraked
AIs, gengineered slave species, nanotech replicators,
weapons of planetary destruction… the Perimeter
hunted down experimenters with a great indifference to planetary laws. Most Perimeter Agencies
collapsed during the Silence, but a few managed to
hold on to their mission, though modern Perimeter
agents often find more work as conventional spies.

The world is noted for an important spiritual or historical location, and might be the sector headquarters for a widespread religion or political movement.
The site attracts wealthy pilgrims from throughout
nearby space, and those with the money necessary to
manage interstellar travel can be quite generous to
the site and its keepers. The locals tend to be fiercely
protective of the place and its reputation, and some
places may forbid the entrance of those not suitably

Pleasure World

Police State

This world provides delights either rare or impermissible elsewhere. Matchless local beauty, stunningly
gengineered natives, a wide variety of local drugs,
carnal pleasures unacceptable on other worlds, or
some other rare delight is readily available here. Most
worlds are fully aware of the value of their offerings,
and the prices they demand can be in credits or in less
tangible recompense.

The world is a totalitarian police state. Any sign of
disloyalty to the planet’s rulers is punished severely,
and suspicion riddles society. Some worlds might operate by Soviet-style informers and indoctrination,
while more technically sophisticated worlds might
rely on omnipresent cameras or braked AI “guardian
angels”. Outworlders are apt to be treated as a necessary evil at best, and “disappeared” if they become
troublesome.

Post-Scarcity

Preceptor Archive

The locals have maintained sufficient Mandate-era
tech to be effectively post-scarcity in their economic
structure. Everyone has all the necessities and most
of the desires they can imagine. Conflict now exists
over the apportionment of services and terrestrial
space, since anything else can be had in abundance.
Military goods and items of mass destruction may
still be restricted, and there is probably some reason
that the locals do not export their vast wealth.

The Preceptors of the Great Archive were a pre-Silence organization devoted to ensuring the dissemination of human culture, history, and basic technology to frontier worlds that risked losing this
information during the human expansion. Most
frontier planets had an Archive where natives could
learn useful technical skills in addition to human history and art. Those Archives that managed to survive
the Silence now strive to send their missionaries of
knowledge to new worlds in need of their lore.

Pretech Cultists

Primitive Aliens

The capacities of human science before the Silence
vastly outmatch the technology available since the
Scream. The Jump Gates alone were capable of crossing hundreds of light years in a moment, and they
were just one example of the results won by blending
psychic artifice with pretech science. Some worlds
outright worship the artifacts of their ancestors, seeing in them the work of more enlightened and perfect
humanity. These cultists may or may not understand
the operation or replication of these devices, but they
seek and guard them jealously.

The world is populated by a large number of sapient
aliens that have yet to develop advanced technology.

Prison Planet

Psionics Academy

This planet is or was intended as a prison. Some such
prisons were meant for specific malefactors of the
Terran Mandate, while others were to contain entire “dangerous” ethnic groups or alien races. Some
may still have warden AIs or automatic systems to
prevent any unauthorized person from leaving, and
any authorization permits have long since expired.

This world is one of the few that have managed to
redevelop the basics of psychic training. Without
this education, a potential psychic is doomed to either madness or death unless they refrain from using
their abilities. Psionic academies are rare enough that
offworlders are often sent there to study by wealthy
patrons. The secrets of psychic mentorship, the
protocols and techniques that allow a psychic to
successfully train another, are carefully guarded at
these academies. Most are closely affiliated with the

Psionics Fear

Psionics Worship

The locals are terrified of psychics. Perhaps their
history is studded with feral psychics who went on
murderous rampages, or perhaps they simply nurse
an unreasoning terror of those “mutant freaks”. Psychics demonstrate their powers at risk of their lives.

These natives view psionic powers as a visible gift of
god or sign of superiority. If the world has a functional psychic training academy, psychics occupy almost
all major positions of power and are considered the
natural and proper rulers of the world. If the world
lacks training facilities, it is likely a hodgepodge of
demented cults, with each one dedicated to a marginally-coherent feral prophet and their psychopathic

Radioactive World

The world is under a quarantine, and space travel
to and from it is strictly forbidden. This may be enforced by massive ground batteries that burn any
interlopers from the planet’s sky, or it may be that a
neighboring world runs a persistent blockade.

Whether due to a legacy of atomic warfare unhindered by nuke snuffers or a simple profusion of
radioactive elements, this world glows in the dark.

Refugees

Regional Hegemon

The world teems with refugees, either exiles from another planet who managed to get here, or the human
detritus of some local conflict that have fled to the
remaining stable states. The natives usually regard
the refugees with hostility, an attitude returned by
many among their unwilling guests.

This world has the technological sophistication, natural resources, and determined polity necessary to be
a regional hegemon for the sector. Nearby worlds are
likely either directly subservient to it or tack carefully
to avoid its anger. It may even be the capital of a small
stellar empire.

Restrictive Laws

Revanchists

A myriad of laws, customs, and rules constrain the
inhabitants of this world, and even acts that are completely permissible elsewhere are punished severely
here. The locals may provide lists of these laws to
offworlders, but few non-natives can hope to master
all the important intricacies.

The locals formerly owned another world, or a major nation on the planet formerly owned an additional region of land. Something happened to take
away this control or drive out the former rulers, and
they’ve never forgotten it. The locals are obsessed
with reclaiming their lost lands, and will allow no
questions of practicality to interfere with their cause.

Revolutionaries

Rigid Culture

The world is convulsed by one or more bands of revolutionaries, with some nations perhaps in the grip of
a current revolution. Most of these upheavals can be
expected only to change the general flavor of problems in the polity, but the process of getting there
usually produces a tremendous amount of suffering.

The local culture is extremely rigid. Certain forms of
behavior and belief are absolutely mandated, and any
deviation from these principles is punished, or else
society may be strongly stratified by birth with limited prospects for change. Anything which threatens
the existing social order is feared and shunned.

Rising Hegemon

Ritual Combat

This world is not yet a dominant power in the sector, but it’s well on its way there. Whether through
newly-blossoming economic, military, or cultural
power, they’re extending their influence over their
neighbors and forging new arrangements between
their government and the rulers of nearby worlds.

The locals favor some form of stylized combat to
resolve disputes, provide entertainment, or settle
religious differences. This combat is probably not
normally lethal unless it’s reserved for a specific disposable class of slaves or professionals. Some combat
may involve mastery of esoteric weapons and complex arenas, while other forms might require nothing
more than a declaration in the street and a drawn gun.

Robots

Seagoing Cities

The world has a great many robots on it. Most bots
are going to be non-sentient expert systems, though
an AI with enough computing resources can control many bots at once, and some worlds may have
developed VIs to a degree that individual bots can
seem (or be) sentient. Some worlds might even be
ruled by metal overlords, ones which do not need to
be sentient so long as they have overwhelming force.

Either the world is entirely water or else the land is
simply too dangerous for most humans. Human settlement on this world consists of a number of floating cities that follow the currents and the fish. These
city-ships might have been purpose-built for their
task, or they could be jury-rigged conglomerations
of ships and structures thrown together when the
need for seagoing life become apparent to the locals.

Sealed Menace

Secret Masters

Something on this planet has the potential to create
enormous havoc for the inhabitants if it is not kept
safely contained by its keepers. Whether a massive
seismic fault line suppressed by pretech terraforming
technology, a disease that has to be quarantined within hours of discovery, or an ancient alien relic that
requires regular upkeep in order to prevent planetary
catastrophe, the menace is a constant shadow on the
fearful populace.

The world is actually run by a hidden cabal, acting
through their catspaws in the visible government.
For one reason or another, this group finds it imperative that they not be identified by outsiders, and
in some cases even the planet’s own government may
not realize that they’re actually being manipulated by
hidden masters.

Sectarians

Seismic Instability

The world is torn by violent disagreement between
sectarians of a particular faith. Each views the other
as a damnable heresy in need of extirpation. Local
government may be able to keep open war from
breaking out, but the poisonous hatred divides communities. The nature of the faith may be religious, or
it may be based on some secular ideology.

The local land masses are remarkably unstable, and
regular earthquakes rack the surface. Local construction is either advanced enough to sway and move

Shackled World

Societal Despair

This world is being systematically contained by an
outside power. Some ancient autonomous defense
grid, robot law enforcement, alien artifact, or other
force is preventing the locals from developing certain
technology, or using certain devices, or perhaps from
developing interstellar flight. This limit may or may
not apply to offworlders; in the former case, the PCs
may have to figure out a way to beat the shackles
simply to escape the world.

The world’s dominant society has lost faith in itself.
Whether through some all-consuming war, great
catastrophe, overwhelming outside culture, or religious collapse, the natives no longer believe in their
old values, and search desperately for something new.
Fierce conflict often exists between the last believers

Some extremely important resource is exported from

substance is critical for building spike drives unless
this world is also the first to begin interstellar flight,
but it may be critical to other high-tech processes or
devices. The locals make a large amount of money off
this trade and control of it is of critical importance to
the planet’s rulers, and potentially to outside powers.

The natives here produce something that is both
fabulously valuable and strictly forbidden elsewhere
in the sector. It may be a lethally addictive drug, forbidden gengineering tech, vat-grown “perfect slaves”,
or a useful substance that can only be made through
excruciating human suffering. This treasure is freely traded on the world, but bringing it elsewhere is

Terraform Failure

Theocracy

This world was marginal for human habitation when
it was discovered, but the Mandate or the early government put in pretech terraforming engines to correct its more extreme qualities. The terraforming did
not entirely work, either failing of its own or suffering the destruction of the engines during the Silence.
The natives are only partly adapted to the world’s
current state, and struggle with the environment.

The planet is ruled by the priesthood of the predominant religion or ideology. The rest of the locals may
or may not be terribly pious, but the clergy have the
necessary military strength, popular support or control of resources to maintain their rule. Alternative

Tomb worlds are planets that were once inhabited
by humans before the Silence. The sudden collapse
of the jump gate network and the inability to bring
in the massive food supplies required by the planet
resulted in starvation, warfare, and death. Most tomb
worlds are naturally hostile to human habitation and
could not raise sufficient crops to maintain life. The
few hydroponic facilities were usually destroyed in
the fighting, and all that is left now are ruins, bones,
and silence.

This world is a major crossroads for local interstellar
trade. It is well-positioned at the nexus of several
short-drill trade routes, and has facilities for easy
transfer of valuable cargoes and the fueling and repairing of starships. The natives are accustomed to
outsiders, and a polyglot mass of people from every
nearby world can be found trading here.

Tyranny

Unbraked AI

The local government is brutal and indifferent to the
will of the people. Laws may or may not exist, but
the only one that matters is the whim of the rulers
on any given day. Their minions swagger through
the streets while the common folk live in terror of
their appetites. The only people who stay wealthy are
friends and servants of the ruling class.

Artificial intelligences are costly and difficult to create, requiring a careful sequence of “growth stages”
in order to bring them to sentience before artificial
limits on cognition speed and learning development
are installed. These “brakes” prevent runaway cognition metastasis. This world has an “unbraked AI” on
it, probably with a witting or unwitting corps of servants. Unbraked AIs are quite insane, but they learn

can demonstrate a truly distressing subtlety.

The world’s land area is covered with buildings that

little land area, or are largely-abandoned due to some
past catastrophe. Agriculture and resource extraction
are part of the urban complex, and there may be an
advanced maintenance system that may not be entirely under the control of present natives.

Natural and social conditions on this world have
made it a paradise for its inhabitants, a genuine utopia of happiness and fulfillment. This is normally
the result of drastic human engineering, including
brain-gelding, neurochemical control, personality
curbs, or complete “humanity” redefinitions. Even so,

Warlords

Xenophiles

The world is plagued by warlords. Numerous powerful men and women control private armies sufficiently strong to cow whatever local government
may exist. On the lands they claim, their word is law.
Most spend their time oppressing their own subjects
and murderously pillaging those of their neighbors.
Most like to wrap themselves in the mantle of ideology, religious fervor, or an ostensibly legitimate
right to rule.

The natives of this world are fast friends with a particular alien race. The aliens may have saved the planet at some point in the past, or awed the locals with
superior tech or impressive cultural qualities. The

Xenophobes

Zombies

The natives are intensely averse to dealings with outworlders. Whether through cultural revulsion, fear
of tech contamination, or a genuine immunodeficiency, the locals shun foreigners from offworld and
refuse to have anything to do with them beyond the
bare necessities of contact. Trade may or may not
exist on this world, but if it does, it is almost certainly
conducted by a caste of untouchables and outcasts.

This menace may not take the form of shambling
corpses, but some disease, alien artifact, or crazed
local practice produces men and women with habits similar to those of murderous cannibal undead.
These outbreaks may be regular elements in local society, either provoked by some malevolent creators

160• Atmosphere

Atmosphere
The first step in randomized world generation is determining the planet’s atmosphere. In some cases, this is
going to be preordained; if you want a barren asteroid
base, it’s not going to have any atmosphere at all. If you
want a world teeming with human life, on the other
hand, it almost certainly is going to have a breathable
atmosphere.
Note that if a truly noxious atmosphere, climate,
or biosphere turns up on a random roll, you should
think carefully about what has made humans choose
to live on such a world. Perhaps the original colonists
were prisoners exiled to an open-world prison. It could
be their ancestors sought isolation at all costs. Given its
position in the sector, it might be a vital refueling and
trading port for multiple short-run spike drive courses. The original colonists might have had to make an
emergency landing. Whatever the reason, it takes a
powerful motivation to make a band of colonists decide to make a corrosive, burning hellhole of a planet
their permanent home.

Types of Atmospheres

Corrosive atmospheres are dangerously hostile to conventional vacc suits and other protective gear. They
steadily strip away at a suit’s vent ports, wiring connections, and other weak spots until they eventually break
through and flood the suit with a toxic cocktail that
usually kills a victim in seconds. Weak atmospheres
might require as much as a day to degrade a vacc suit,
while strong ones might accomplish the job in an hour.
Even forcefield-based environment suits such as a FEP
suffer steady damage to their exposed elements.
Native vacc suits are usually covered with an
ablative layer or spray that can be regularly renewed,
and their buildings often rely on a steadily-extruded
slurry of neutralizing materials that can be constantly
renewed by pores in the building surface itself. This
often gives the building a drippy, half-melted look that
may be more than cosmetic in the case of those structures that have failing slurry pumps. Advanced tech
level 5 equipment may be able to overcome the effects,
but even pretech is often taxed by the relentless rigors
of this world. Vehicles and shuttles are kept in pressurized garages when not in use, and starships never
land for long.
Corrosive worlds have a number of intrinsic adventure complications, the largest being the way that
every activity outside of a hab building comes with a
built-in time limit. Whatever the party chooses to do
outside of a building, it has to accomplish before their
suit seals fail or the atmosphere corrodes a hole in their
vehicle hull. A clever GM can use this problem to add
extra tension to an otherwise simple task.
Inert gas atmospheres aren’t hostile or poisonous,
but they’re unbreathable by humans. If the planet’s cli-

mate is otherwise tolerable, the natives might be able
to live and work outdoors without anything more than
an air tank and face mask. Some degree of technical
sophistication is going to be necessary for humanity
to survive, and large supplies of oxygen are going to
have to be extracted from some local source. “Air mines”
might exist to replace the oxygen lost during human
use, or local power plants might need to be kept running full blast in order to crack water molecules into
hydrogen and oxygen.
On worlds with an unbreathable atmosphere, control of the air supply makes it much harder for locals
to rebel against their leaders. Without the equipment
and power to generate their own air supplies, would-be
rebels are entirely at the mercy of those who control
the oxygen. Most rulers pick up on this fact rapidly, and
some worlds with unbreathable atmospheres might
even make it a crime to own illicit oxygen generation
equipment.
Airless or thin atmospheres are appropriate to asteroids, rocky planetoids, or barren worlds that have
had their atmospheres burnt off by weapons or cosmic caprice. Whatever atmosphere exists is too thin
to support human life, if it exists at all, and the world
is largely naked to the chill of space and the blaze of
stellar heat. Exposure to the planet’s surface without a
vacc suit or pressurized building is as lethal as exposure
to hard vacuum.
Airless worlds are hostile to human life, but they
excel at preserving the relics of the past. Provided that
the ruins or remains are kept out of the baking heat of
the local stellar body and the impact of random meteorites, they can survive for millions of years. Some
exceptionally ancient alien ruins might even date back
from before the world lost its atmosphere.
Breathable mix atmospheres can support human
life without additional equipment or gengineered modification. Any world that has a human population in
the millions or more almost certainly has a breathable
mix atmosphere.
While the air is breathable, almost every world
has its own subtle cocktail of inert gases, atmospheric contaminants, and other odoriferous ingredients.
For spacers accustomed to the filtered air supply of a

Atmosphere •161
starship, the “new world stink” of a fresh planetfall can
be maddening, as few linger long enough to get used
to the smell of the local air. Attempting to explain the
source of this discomfort to the locals rarely results in
positive results. Some spaceport bars make a point of
their air filtration and composition mixers.
Thick atmospheres can usually be breathed with the
aid of a filter mask, though the mix of contaminants
renders it slowly or quickly toxic to humans who attempt to breathe it straight. Separate air supplies are
not necessary to supplement the blend, but any society that means to survive on such a world must have
sufficient technological expertise to manufacture and
maintain large numbers of filter masks.
Thick atmospheres are often at least semi-opaque,
and some worlds have thick atmospheres that are completely impenetrable to ordinary light. Deep banks of
permanent fog might shroud the planet, or natives
might have to go about with sophisticated ultraviolet
or infrared viewing equipment if they don’t wish to be
blind. Some banks of gases might be impenetrable to
even these viewing tools, leaving a party vulnerable
to moments of complete blindness while out on the
surface of the world.
Invasive toxic atmospheres are composed of a
substantial proportion of molecules small enough to
infiltrate past the seals of most vacc suits. This infiltration doesn’t harm the suit, but the molecules have to
be steadily flushed by the system’s purification sensors
before they build up to a debilitating level. This causes a much faster bleed of air as breathable oxygen is
jettisoned along with the infiltrating molecules. Most

invasive atmospheres cut oxygen supply durations by
half, at best.
Invasive atmospheres make oxygen an even more
important resource than it is on inert gas worlds. Outdoor work is avoided whenever possible, as any failure
of a suit’s toxin sensors or flush system can lead to death
before the wearer even realizes something is wrong.
Steady exposure to low levels of the toxins can also
result in unfortunate effects even with a fully-functional suit. Hallucinations, chronic sickness, or worse
can follow.
Corrosive and invasive atmospheres exist at the
very border of what human society can tolerate. Combining all the worst traits of an eroding, corrosive atmosphere and the invasive intrusion of toxic molecules,
a planet cursed with an atmosphere like this is far more
hostile than any mere airless rock.
Advanced pretech filtering and oxygen generation
equipment might be able to maintain tolerable pressurized habitats and hydroponic systems uncontaminated
by exterior atmosphere. Anything less than this tech
level means greater and greater amounts of societal
resources devoted simply to the effort of breathing.
Entire civilizations can be oriented around overcoming the difficulties of maintaining their structures and
their pressurized homes.
Whatever provoked the initial inhabitants to settle
on this world must have been of overwhelming value
or necessity to convince them to consign themselves
and their children to such a place. It is highly unlikely
that enough ship traffic exists to get any but the most
fortunate locals offworld, so the rest are obliged to deal
with their harsh existence as best they can.

162• Temperature

Temperature
A world’s average temperature depends in large part
upon its atmosphere. Worlds with an airless or thin
atmosphere are directly exposed to the wild temperature variations produced by stellar radiation and the
cold void of space, and might flip regularly between
unendurable heat and near-absolute zero depending
on planetary rotation and orbit.
If a GM intends this planet to have a large human population they should restrict the possibility of
a frozen or burning world. Anything that is intolerable to a human without a vacc suit means that major
agriculture is unlikely. As it is effectively impossible to
feed entire planets through limited interstellar trade,
every planet needs to support its own population. A
world that can’t grow food outside of hydroponic labs
or underground farms is unlikely to support millions
of people.

Types of Climates

Frozen worlds are those with so weak a stellar primary
or so great a distance that the average temperature is
close to absolute zero. Any atmosphere that once existed has long since frozen into drifts of solidified oxygen
or lakes of liquid helium. Exposure to these drifts is
very dangerous. Vacc suits maintain a tolerable temperature easily because the stellar void is very empty,
and there is little conduction of heat between the suit
and empty space. Dunking a suit into a lake of thermally-conductive superchilled liquid can force the heating
elements into sudden and drastic overload, draining a
power cell in minutes or even seconds.
Cold worlds are uncomfortable, but a human can
survive on them in nothing more than heavy clothing.
The worst of the cold worlds are similar in condition
to Earth’s Antarctic regions, barren wastes of ice and
wind. The more clement ones have brief warmer seasons or equatorial bands that get enough solar radiation
to support substantial agriculture.
On cold worlds, agricultural land is at a premium. The population is unlikely to be willing to limit its
numbers to what hydroponic farms can provide, and
they may lack the technology for wide-scale artificial
production methods. Savage wars may have broken out
over control of fertile growing regions, and populations have perhaps been driven away from the arable
land into the cold zones and a lingering death.
Some worlds retain installations from before the
Silence deep within the frozen wastes, ancient bases
and laboratories that were planted in an age when
good launch sites and orbital windows meant more
than trifles of temperature. These lost sites might be
remembered in legend and story, and some native leaders might still be in possession of the automatic defense
bypass codes handed down by their ancestors.

Temperate worlds were the most popular colony
sites, and most of the truly populous worlds of the
frontier have a temperate climate. Many temperate
worlds have temperature ranges not unlike that of
Earth, though most are canted a little further toward
cold or heat depending on their angle and proximity
to the local star.
Temperate worlds are the most likely to teem with
native life as well, and to have alien ruins or remains
located somewhere on their surface. Most frontier
worlds never accumulated enough population to put a
serious strain on a temperate world’s arable land, but
this same capaciousness often allows for more complicated social divisions to develop. Natives of other
worlds are often forced to cooperate or die, while those
of a clement temperate world have the luxury of deep
and lasting divisions.
Warm worlds come in two main flavors, depending on the prevalence of water. “Desert worlds” are hot
enough or arid enough to be deprived of most surface
water. Any life on such a planet has to be capable of
extracting water from living prey, air currents or moisture supplies deep underground. Humans can survive
on warm worlds without more than appropriate clothing, but desert-world humans must learn sophisticated
techniques of water prospecting and well-drilling in
order to maintain their agricultural systems. Warfare
often revolves around these water systems.
The other common variety of warm world is one
blessed with an abundance of surface water. These
worlds tend to be covered with plant and animal life,
teeming with thick jungles and vast mats of sargasso on
seas that boil with piscids and other alien life analogs.
These worlds can be quite prosperous for humans if the
native life is edible, but inhabitants are often forced to
deal with large predators and a vigorously ingenious
native ecology of disease.
Variable temperature worlds tend to show a greater
distribution of climates than other worlds, either ranging from cold to temperate levels or temperate to hot
levels. This may be a climate that changes world-wide
when a long, slow orbit brings the planet into proximity with a stellar primary, or it might be a world
that has substantially different climatic zones spread

Temperature •163
across its surface. The north pole of one world might
be a sun-blasted desert that moderates to a cool, wet
equator, or an icy world might be warmed here and
there by complex channels of geothermally-heated
subsurface rivers. Variable temperature worlds tend
to have savage weather. The mixing of hot and cold
air can send ferocious cyclones and raging hurricanes
across the surface of the world, some large enough to
consume most of a hemisphere.
Burning worlds are too hot for a human to survive
without equipment similar to a vacc suit in effectiveness. Rivulets of molten lead or copper might bleed
from open veins on the hillsides, and many of the same
perils that face an explorer on a frozen world have hotter equivalents on a burning one. Ash drifts, pools of
molten metal, and superheated liquid vents can bring
quick death to an unwary explorer, and the miners who
inhabit such worlds must be forever vigilant against the
perils of their burning home.

Climate and Adventure

Any planet with Burning or Frozen conditions is going to need some kind of sealed habitat for humanity.
Worlds of Cold or Warm temperatures are at least habitable outside of their most extreme zones, though icy
planets might not have much arable land on the outside.
As a consequence, planets with Frozen or Burning
temperatures tend to have the climate as a backdrop
rather than something the PCs regularly need to deal
with. If they’ve landed on such a world’s spaceport, it’s
probably sealed in some subterranean hangar-cavern
or domed over by massive civil engineering. The ice
or flame might be a constant concern of the locals, but
the PCs aren’t going to have to cope with it unless they
have to leave the inhabited regions of the planet.
On Burning worlds, this isn’t going to happen very
often. Any habitat without active climate control is going to be melted or torched by local conditions in short
order. There will be no ruins to explore or remnants to
recover unless they’re somehow fireproof.
The easiest use of a Burning world’s temperature
is as a threat to the locals or the PCs. If something isn’t
fixed, or if something is destroyed, or if some place isn’t
evacuated in time, then things will get intolerably hot.
There’s usually a grace period of increasing temperature to help add urgency to the situation and layer on
potential penalties or dangers as the PCs struggle to
cope with the situation.
Frozen worlds can be equally lethal if a flood of
liquid oxygen threatens to sweep through a habitat or
a cold-brittled vital component breaks down. More
significantly to PCs, however, frozen worlds tend to
be much better about preserving ruins and remains.
The PCs might be forced to deal with the frigid temperatures as they search through an alien structure or
the icy halls of a dead habitat. Such conditions can lead
to strict time limits on an expedition before materials
start to brittle and fail under the relentless chill.

164• Biosphere

Biosphere
Some worlds are highly unlikely to have a biosphere.
An airless rock, a frozen wasteland, or a world of boiling tin all are unlikely to host any sort of life more
sophisticated than microbes, though the universe has
demonstrated the existence of a few exotic creatures
even on seemingly unendurable planets.
The real question of a biosphere is whether or not
it’s edible. Colonists on a world without edible local life
are forced to seed and grow Terran crops, which may
well be outcompeted by native life specifically evolved
for this world. Such colonists might well end up starving amid gardens of alien fruit, unable to digest any of
it. The only benefit of such worlds is the likelihood that
humans are just as poisonous to local life, though many
large predators don’t realize that until after they devour
some luckless colonist.

Types of Biosphere

Biosphere remnants are the wreckage of a ruined ecology. Petrified trees, drifts of preserved bones, forests
of dead plant life; something killed all the life on this
planet in the relatively recent past. It may have been the
exercise of a maltech planet-buster weapon, or a mutant microbe introduced by human colonists, or some
volcanic eruption or asteroid impact that plunged the
world into decades of frozen night.
Any local civilization not sophisticated enough to
escape the planet likely died when it did. Their ruins
and remains might be found throughout the desolate
wastes, along with more clues as to the cause of the
devastation.
Microbial life is often the only thing that exists on
the more inhospitable planets, yet the wide variety of
environments that can accommodate life means that
these little beasts show up in some of the most unlikely places. Some varieties of slime mold have even
managed to evolve on corrosive-atmosphere planets,
forming a mucous-like outer shell against the atmosphere and then feeding and growing off the chemical
byproducts of its erosion.
Microbial life can also be dangerous. While most
alien microbes are unable to infect or harm the radically
different biology of humans, some show enough ingenuity to accomplish even that difficult feat. Rumors of
terrible “space plagues” that leave behind only drifting
ships and garbled warnings remain a steady staple at
spacer bars throughout the known universe.
No native biosphere is occasionally found on even
the most temperate and otherwise habitable worlds.
For one reason or another, life simply never evolved
on these worlds, leaving them a blank slate for the agricultural and ecological efforts of humans. If the world
is otherwise amenable to Terran life, such planets can
be enormously fertile and agriculturally rich.

They can also be disasters waiting to happen. Pretech xenobiologists compiled standardized colonization
packages of plants, animals, and insect life designed to
expand smoothly and evenly to fill the niches of an uninhabited world. Not all colonists implemented these
packages correctly, and some worlds had disasters or
special circumstances that destabilized their efforts.
Some empty worlds are now in a state of constant biological flux as the local ecology strives vainly to find
some sort of equilibrium between the myriad imported
species and their violent struggle.
More subtly, these worlds can be suddenly and
drastically destabilized by the import of some offworld
plant or animal. With no strong native ecology to fight
off interlopers, the wrong beast or bug can lay waste to
whole continents. These planets tend to be extremely
paranoid about importation of foreign life forms.
Human-miscible biospheres are those in which
some substantial portion of the native life is biologically compatible with human nutritional needs. The
local plants and animals may not be tasty or terribly
nourishing, but they can support life without the serious importation of Terran crop seeds and livestock.
Even the friendlier human-miscible biospheres
often lack the wide variety of edibles that evolved on
Earth, and the natives often supplement their stocks
of local foods with limited Terran agriculture. Exotic
foods, spices, and liquors can be worth interstellar importation to feed the hunger for novelty possessed by
the elites on these worlds.
Unfortunately, the fact that humans can eat some
native life means that it is very likely that some native life can eat humans as well. Large predators and
diseases capable of human infection are by no means
uncommon on these worlds, and small colonies can be
hard-pressed to survive them.
Immiscible biospheres are not friendly to humans.
None of the local plants or animals are edible, and anything the colony needs to eat will have to be grown
from Terran stock. Worse, it is common for the pollen
and other microbial life of these worlds to be highly
allergenic to humans, requiring the regular use of tailored antiallergenics to prevent eventual respiratory
failure or exotic immune-system reactions.

Biosphere •165
These worlds are exceptionally susceptible to the
temptation of human gengineering. Despite the persistent drawbacks, genetic flaws, and handicaps that human gengineering usually introduces in a subject, the
desperate need to eat can drive worlds to wholesale
experimentation on their progeny. The resultant altered humans are often able to digest the local food, but
commonly pay for it in shortened life spans, physical
disabilities, or an inability to consume Terran foodstuffs. Sometimes the consequences are worse still.
Immiscible biospheres produce some of the most
exotic plants and animals in human space. Unfettered
by the limits of familiar evolutionary patterns, creatures of bizarre beauty and strange configurations are
found on many of these worlds. Many lack the intelligence to realize that humans are as poisonous to them
as they are to humans.
Hybrid biospheres are a stable intermixing of Terran flora and fauna with local life forms. Most such
worlds have been colonized for centuries before the
Silence, giving the local ecology time to shake out into
a relatively stable configuration of Earth-born organisms and native life. The native biology may or may
not be miscible with human life, but it is unlikely to be
particularly hostile in any case, or else the interloping
life forms would not have been able to get a foothold
on the planet.
Hybrid biospheres often show strange examples
of symbiosis and adaptation, with plants and animals

forming new alliances. Large predators from one world
may find themselves subsisting on herds of herbivorous alien life, while Terran vegetation provides sustenance for large populations of small, furred, insect-like
grazers. Familiar animals may show seemingly bizarre
behavior patterns that have formed in response to local
conditions, perhaps becoming larger or more aggressive, or having been gengineered for compatibility.
Engineered biospheres are among the rarest, as
they require enormous time and effort on the part of
a highly advanced civilization. Whatever life exists on
this planet has been extensively altered by an alien race
or by advanced pretech gengineering methods. Some
such worlds are paradise planets, carefully sculpted by
some fabulously wealthy predecessor to suit their own
tastes. Others are living forges, where foodstuffs and
refined minerals are produced as byproducts from the
basic organic processes of the world’s biosphere.
Such worlds tend to be fragile. Many engineered
worlds are dependent upon regular stabilizing work to
prevent genetic drift and adaptations that do not serve
the creator’s purpose. Without regular pruning and
adjustment, engineered biospheres can go badly awry.
Some end up leaving nothing but genetic wreckage
in their wake, while others go wrong in more subtle
ways. Where once the biosphere existed to serve the
inhabitants, a creaking engineered biosphere can leave
the planet’s population chained to constant repair and
maintenance efforts just to prevent a planetary collapse.

166• Population

Population
Planetary populations hinge on a world’s habitability. Worlds incapable of growing food on the planet’s
surface are unlikely to have more than a few hundred
thousand inhabitants at best, and truly inimical worlds
might be lucky to have a tenth as many. As a rule of
thumb, a world ought to have some kind of human
habitation on it unless the GM has a specific purpose
for it in mind. A world untouched by human presence
can be interesting in many ways, but without elaboration there’s little to distinguish it from the next airless
ball of rock.
Humans breed quickly, and will tend to push up
against the limits of a world’s capacity to feed and support them. Some cultures with sufficient tech might
rely on contraceptives and birth licensing to ensure
sufficient food for its population, while others might
choose or be forced to leave matters to simple Malthusian culling. Wars and diseases may also serve as
a check on population, or in some cases, cultures may
find themselves so wealthy, self-absorbed and comfortable as to voluntarily choose not to reproduce.

Population Sizes

Failed colonies are occasionally found dotting the worlds
of human space. Some date back to the First Wave of
human colonization more than a thousand years ago,
while others are more recent efforts that guttered out
under the strains of a colony’s birth.
Pirate attacks might have wiped out a young colony, as might a hostile biosphere, alien attack, internal
dissension, disease outbreaks, failure of vital colonial
equipment, or any one of a hundred other disasters.
The ruins of the colony might still have valuable pretech artifacts, however, or colonization deeds authorized by neighboring worlds. A few survivors might
even have clung to life in the intervening centuries,
maintaining some sort of society in the wreckage of
their ancestors’ work.
Outposts are rarely composed of more than a few
hundred or few thousand colonists at the most. Outposts are either very new colonies that have not have
the requisite time to grow or they are uncolonized
worlds that just happen to have a naval or corporate
base on the surface.
Corporate or military outposts aren’t intended to
be completely self-sufficient. While large outposts are
often forced to raise their own food supplies, replacement personnel, spare parts, and advanced tech must
all be brought in from elsewhere. Such temporary outposts are known to find themselves in sudden distress
when a vital supply ship fails to make its drop or when
some local threat proves more than the staff can handle.
Colonial outposts tend to be better equipped but
with less outside backing. Such natives expect to live
and die on the world, and are more inclined to build

permanent structures and local improvements. Many
are exiles, malcontents, or others incapable of tolerating the world that sent them forth, and it can make for
a somewhat explosive mix in a young colony. These
pioneers tend to be very friendly towards visiting
starships, as they are often dependent upon free traders and tramp merchants to bring them vital supplies
or news of the sector.
Some “outposts” are really just the stubborn, persistent survivors of a long-failed colonization attempt.
These cultures can survive for centuries, perpetually
culled by the dangers of the world until the survivors
are little more than one more ragged element of the
local ecology.
Fewer than a million inhabitants are often found on
newly-colonized worlds, or those with limited arable
land. This class has the widest range of results, from
societies barely large enough to avoid inbreeding to
minor worlds of several hundred thousand locals struggling against hostile local conditions.
For worlds with a very small population, settlements tend to be clustered close to one another for
mutual support and efficient exploitation of land. The
atmosphere might be something like that of a village-dotted countryside, with too few people to support
large, specialized cities. The major settlement of the
planet is usually built around the spaceport.
Politics on planets with so few people tend to be
very personal in nature. Individual leaders can sometimes address the entire population of a world at a
single meeting, and networks of family, friends, and
employees can dominate the local social life. This small
population combined with limited outside contact can
result in somewhat… unusual societies more strongly
influenced by a leader’s personal quirks than a more
populous planet might be. Some such worlds can grow
decidedly unhealthy in their customs and traditions.
Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants make up
the population of many frontier worlds, usually ones
with adequate supplies of arable land and surface conditions amenable to a human without a vacc suit or filter
mask. This level of population is also usually the most
that a world at TL4 can support using only artificial
hydroponic complexes and sealed agricultural systems,

Population •167
so less hospitable planets rarely have more than this
many inhabitants.
At a hundred thousand citizens or more, city-states
and hub settlements start to form, and some major political divisions might exist beneath the overall planetary government. Regional variations start to become
present as towns and smaller settlements start to assert
their own cultural traits. Young colonies rarely have
much of a framework for resolving these new tensions,
and it’s not uncommon for outsiders to end up as catspaws for varying factions.
A hundred thousand inhabitants is normally
the smallest population that can create spike driveequipped starships. Less populous worlds rarely have
the broad range of specialists and workers necessary
to build such ships, even if they possess the necessary
technical information. Even at this threshold, maintaining any kind of astronautic industry would require
the determined focus of the entire society. Only at populations of a million-plus inhabitants is there enough
of an industrial margin to allow for less determined
construction of spike drive starships.
Millions of inhabitants are found on some of the
more populous frontier worlds, those planets with an
excellent climate and soil for agriculture. These worlds
teem with human life compared to most of their neighbors, and if they have sufficient technological expertise to build spike drives, they probably are among the
significant powers of the sector. The sheer amount
of labor and expertise they can put into their projects
dwarfs the capabilities of less populated worlds.
Some worlds of this type fail to coalesce under a
unified planetary government, however, and turn most
of their attention to intra-planetary quarrels between
different nations or city-states. Full-scale planetary
wars have been known to break out on such worlds,
with some being reduced to burnt-out cinders by some
maltech weapon or by nuclear attacks against regions
stripped of their nuke snuffers.
Billions of inhabitants on a world is a freak occurrence in most sectors, a circumstance dependent on
almost perfect planetary conditions, a First Wave date
of colonization, a very large initial colonial expedition,
and a strong cultural imperative for reproduction.
These worlds have been colonized for almost a thousand years, and have likely gone through substantial
cultural development and change since their founding.
Planets with this many inhabitants tend to come
in two main varieties. The more common is that of
regional hegemon, leveraging its enormous reserves
of labor and scientific personnel to build hundreds or
thousands of starships. Some hegemons might even
have the transport weight and personnel available to
colonize or conquer their less powerful neighbors outright, though most hegemons prefer the safer route of
docile client states rather than outright conquest.
Not all such worlds have the necessary resources
to build starships, even when the labor is cheap and

abundant. These worlds tend to take a different route,
becoming balkanized, conflict-torn planets not unlike
a mid-20th-century Earth. Resource wars are common
and local politics revolve around byzantine feuds and
ancient slights. Technology on such planets tends to be
very uneven; it is limited or nonexistent in fields that
depend on unavailable resources, but the natives often
show remarkable sophistication in making the most of
what they have available.
Alien civilizations are even rarer than massively human-populated planets, but they can be found in some
sectors. On these worlds, any human presence is either
nonexistent or simply a token contingent of traders and
diplomats. The actual number of aliens may range from
a few tens of thousands to teeming worlds of billions.
Alien civilizations appear to be no more immune
to conflict, disaster, and decadence than that of humans,
and most alien worlds are isolated planets. Some sectors were known to be dominated by alien empires before the Scream, but most inhabited worlds found by
colonial surveyors consisted of indigenous, low-tech
sapients who evolved on the world, or else were the
decaying remnants of a former empire that had fallen
apart into isolated colonial worlds.
This fate of growth, expansion, colonization, and
collapse appears to be a very common event in the galaxy. Countless alien ruins and lost deep-space artifacts
indicate that cycles of growth and decay have been
going on for millennia, and there is little way to tell
how many alien empires have swept over what is now
human space before dwindling to rotting worlds and
then empty ruins.

Population Growth

Most worlds have reached an equilibrium state with
their current populations. While there may be some
variation, few worlds are likely to increase much without a drastic change in the local conditions.
For primitive worlds, this limit has been reached
in brutally Malthusian fashion. The locals simply cannot support any substantial increase of their numbers,
and additional population is restricted by widespread
contraceptive use, selective infanticide, or regular
bouts of mass starvation. The only way out of this trap
is through advanced technology that can overcome
the local resource limitations, after which such worlds
might explode in population over a scant few decades.
For more advanced worlds, this limit tends to be
organic to the culture. With sophisticated technology to supply abundant entertainment and sustenance,
there is less importance in having offspring to labor
for the family or nourish its aged members. Individuals become more interested in their own pleasures and
ambitions than in the burdensome work of child-rearing, and population tends to slope downward until
cultural mores reinforce a certain basic minimum of
reproduction. A drastic change in cultural attitudes or
an increase in societal uncertainty can alter this rapidly.

168• Tech Level

Tech Level
The tech level of a world represents not only the level of technological progress and scientific knowledge
available on it, but also the world’s ability to translate
that knowledge into effective production. A world
might still guard texts describing elaborate principles
of petrochemical manipulation, but without oil or
fossil fuels on the planet they have no way to use the
information. It is this kind of resource limitation that
most often keeps a world caught at a low level of tech.
Without bottleneck resources such as petrochemicals
or radioactives, they can’t develop the technology that
would allow them to do without such resources.
Tech level 4 is the baseline level of development for
planets capable of building fusion plants, spike-drive
equipped starships, limited longevity enhancements,
and basic energy weapons. A planet without this level
of development is effectively cut off from interstellar
news and trade without the good offices of far traders,
explorers, or scavenger fleet contacts.
Tech levels are rough approximations, and every
planet is going to have variance within that range. A
decayed colony is unlikely to have forgotten the basics
of human anatomy and practical wound care, but they
may not have the local resources to fashion medical
tools more sophisticated than obsidian scalpels and
herbal poultices. By the same token, a primitive world
might have local resources that are exceptionally useful
in one or two narrow ranges of technology.

Planetary Tech Levels

Tech level 0 represents a world with technologies similar to neolithic-era humanity. Very few worlds collapse
this far without dying out completely, and so a world
this primitive is very rare in human space. The world
is so profoundly devoid of useful resources that the
natives may simply not have anything better to work
with than rocks and native vegetation.
Natives of a world at this tech level might retain
elaborate cultural artifacts and a very sophisticated
society. Existing resources tend to be exploited to the
hilt, with large populations producing massive stone
cities, human-powered engines for irrigation, and vast
displays of foodstuffs and craft work for the ruling class.
Despite this, the lack of metal, domesticated beasts of
burden, and petrochemicals puts a hard stop on the
technological development of most of these worlds.
Responses to far traders and other interstellar
travelers will vary with the local culture. The lack of
quick communications methods tends to result in large
populations breaking up into numerous smaller regional cultures, and the friendly prince of one domain
might neighbor an implacably hostile sage-king. Most
“lostworlders” have a keen appreciation for the benefits
these strangers from the sky can bring them, and will

Some worlds might retain crisply rational records
of their colonization and downfall. Others might preserve tales of a starry origin in legends and story. A few
might have forgotten their origins entirely, and view
sky-born humans as gods or messengers of the divine.
Such awe rarely lasts very long once the merchants or
pirates who landed make their purposes clear.
Tech level 1 worlds have managed to find and exploit metal deposits and likely have imported or domesticated beasts of burden. Those worlds with easy access
to fossil fuels or a similarly energy-dense substance can
advance to greater things, but a culture trapped at TL1
is unlikely to have access to such helpful resources. A
few worlds have enough usable plant matter or other
combustibles to make steam engines feasible, but those
with very much of such a resource usually make the
leap to the next tech level eventually.
As a consequence, tech level 1 worlds tend to be
caught at much the same general level of development
as their tech level 0 cousins. They may have elaborate
social structures and cultural development, but they
are unable to mechanize without some energy-dense
resource to serve as fuel. The scavenged hulks of their
ancestors’ fusion plants may stand as mute temples to
the achievements of their forebears, but without the
tech necessary to repair and rebuild such edifices the
world is dependent on purely local fuel sources.
Tech level 1 worlds tend to respond to visitors in
much the same way as tech level 0 planets. The ruling
class of these worlds is liable to be able to muster larger
cities, bigger armies, and all the other perquisites that
come from being able to work the available agricultural
land with fewer hands.
Tech level 2 worlds are blessed with the presence of
fossil fuels or a feasibly abundant biofuel source. Internal combustion engines are crude things compared to
the power of a fusion plant, but they can be built with
primitive tools and a basic degree of education. The
mechanization that results from this resource vastly
increases the efficiency of local farming, the speed of
travel, and the productivity of factory workers.
Most tech level 2 worlds are “knockdowns”; planets that once had a much higher degree of sophistication but were recently crippled by disease, disaster,

Tech Level •169
or invasion. The natives tend to be keenly aware of
the glories of former generations, and work fiercely to
redevelop lost techniques and reclaim old knowledge.
Few tech level 2 worlds produce much that’s worth
interstellar trade. Most foodstuffs are too bulky and
cheap to make it worth a captain’s time. Some worlds
have rare ore deposits, but the natives have no reason
to dig them until a merchant makes it worth their while
to set up a whole new industry for export. Some such
worlds barter the relics of their ancestors in exchange
for educational materials or rare resources necessary
for advancing local industry. Others feel forced to trade
native work contracts for dangerous, dirty labor in a
bargain that’s little different from slave trading.
Tech level 3 worlds are those that have developed
to a level much like that of the more advanced nations
of late twentieth-century Earth. The main difference
between tech level 3 worlds and level 4 worlds is the
lack of fusion power or spike drive manufacture.
These worlds come in two major varieties. The
first is a “knockdown” world that formerly had tech
level 4 technologies before some catastrophe or pirate
attack destroyed their knowledge and industrial base.
Some of the wrecked infrastructure might have been
irreplaceable, and the world must struggle to regain its
former level of technological production. Worlds in
this condition tend to have rather small populations
that are susceptible to the loss of a few concentrated
groups of experts.
The second major variety is a world that suffered
a severe disaster shortly after colonization and has
been forced to painstakingly build up their technological base ever since. Some of these worlds date back to
the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago,
driven into near-neolithic conditions by some outside
pressure before slowly and painfully rebuilding their
technological base through purely indigenous efforts.
These worlds tend to have very large populations if the
world’s climate permits, as they have been colonized for
quite some time.
Simply providing a world with the necessary technical data for advancement doesn’t mean that advancement will be quick or even. Even if a tech level 3 world
has the necessary resources to build tech level 4 devices,
it may take as much as a generation for a world to build
the necessary infrastructure and resource extraction
enterprises. The time may be longer still if the dominant cultures are uneasy with the new technology.
Tech level 4 worlds are the most common in human space, and their technical expertise is the baseline
for modern post-Silence “postech”. These worlds can
create spike drives rated up to drive-3, fusion power plants, grav vehicles, simple energy weapons, and
medicines that extend human life to a hundred years of
vigorous good health. They can manage sophisticated
gengineering on simple life forms, and some tech level
4 worlds have even attempted to improve the genetic
structures of human life itself. These attempts have yet

to produce results without severe drawbacks, but some
such worlds remain populated by altered humanity
designed to cope with local conditions more perfectly
than baseline humans.
Most worlds with regular interstellar contact and
the necessary raw resources eventually gravitate towards this level of technological expertise. It may take
decades, or even centuries in the case of more retrograde worlds, but this tech level is the highest that can
readily be achieved by most planets.
Tech level 4 with specialties is an unusual case of
a normal tech level 4 world that has retained some
pretech industries or has developed their own local
technical expertise beyond baseline postech in certain
specific fields.
Most such specialties are relatively narrow in
scope; grav tech, medicine, hydroponics, force field
generation, or some field of roughly similar breadth.
These specialties are usually either the product of a
few irreplaceable pretech manufactories or the result
of some unique local resource that serves amazingly
well for the purpose at hand. In both cases, the world
will jealously guard the tech, and much local conflict
may relate to control over these resources.
These worlds tend to have substantial amounts of
interstellar trade from neighboring worlds interested
in their tech. The ruling elite of the world can be ostentatious about display of this wealth.
Tech level 5 is the highest tech level that might
merit random placement. A world with this level of
technological expertise has somehow managed to
hold on to the majority of the pre-Scream technology
base, and can produce a wide range of goods that are
unknown on less sophisticated worlds. Miniaturized
fusion plants, drive-6 rated spike drives, exotic grav
weaponry, and even the development of psionics-based
“psitech” is possible on such a world.
Pretech manufacturing was largely dependent on
specially-trained industrial psychics. With the loss of
their unique disciplines in the Scream, most worlds
that retain this level of tech classification were forced
to substitute slower, less precise methods that sharply
curtailed their production efficiency. Barring the profoundly unlikely happenstance of this world’s redevelopment of the lost disciplines, their maximum industrial output is sharply limited. Even on worlds such as
this, most technology is likely mass-produced postech,
with only important goods produced to pretech levels
of quality.
A world with this level of technology is almost
certainly a regional hegemon, one of the most powerful and influential worlds in the sector. Even those
worlds that have no imperial ambitions have enormous
influence simply through the vast superiority of their
starships and military technology.

170• System Points of Interest

Additional System Points of Interest
The world you’re creating is the most interesting or
important place in this solar system, but it may not be
the only one. If you wish, you can decorate the system
with other points of interest worth PC attention. You
might do this at the same time you roll up the system’s
primary world, or you could wait until it becomes a
significant point in play.

Adding Other Worlds

For simplicity’s sake, it’s often best to just stick with
one inhabited world. The original colonists would have
chosen the most human-habitable planet in the system,
and unless they grew dramatically in the time before
the Scream they wouldn’t have had reason to colonize
less favorable planets before the catastrophe knocked
out their spaceflight capabilities. Other rocks might be
floating in the system, but they’re probably barren and
uninhabited.
If you do decide to add additional inhabited planets
to the system, you can generate them normally, but
you’ll want to ask yourself a few special questions. The
table below offers some ideas for potential answers.
First, what is the origin of the world, and how does
it relate to the primary world in the system? Knowing
where this secondary planet’s inhabitants came from
can often give you answers to a host of other questions.
Second, how do they feel about the primary world?
If you generate three or more worlds, you’ll want to
decide how each of them feels about the other. This
feeling may not necessarily be reciprocal.
Third, what’s the major point of contact between
them and the primary world? If the two are on a friendly basis, this contact might be something that benefits
them both, while a more hostile relationship could
make it a point they’re fighting over or otherwise
struggling to maintain dominance in. In the case of a
mutual threat, it might be something both are facing
with a united front, or it could be the two are struggling
to see who gets thrown to the wolves first.
With these three answers in hand you’ll be able
to flesh out this second planet more easily, adding in
elements from the primary world as needed.

Other Points of Interest

Aside from other inhabited planets, a system can contain a number of other settlements or stations that
could draw PC attention. Most of the time these stations can simply be assumed; a TL4 world is going to
have asteroid mines and refueling stations and listening
posts, and most of these locations have no importance
to the game until the PCs go looking for them.
Other times, however, you’ll want to pre-seed the
system with a few interesting locations. The adjacent
table offers a number of different possibilities to roll
or choose from.
Most of the points are intended to be remote
outposts of the primary world. They might be deepspace research stations, refueling stations on the edge
of the system, bases on isolated gas-giant moons that
have valuable resources, or other far-flung tendrils of
a greater civilization.
Some of these points could be more independent
establishments. A deep-space existence can be made
largely self-sustaining with TL4 engineering, though
the life there is likely primitive and tenuous. With
enough cobbled-together defenses and a lack of anything particularly worth stealing, exile groups, recluses,
and other antisocial sorts can make themselves a private domain that no local planet cares about enough to
commit the resources required to destroy it.
Others among these remote stations become outposts for pirates and other reavers, usually operating
under some deniable cover or protected by enough
defensive installations to dissuade anything short of a
major military assault. The calculus for these robbers
is simple; the effort a planetary navy would have to
make to get rid of them must be more than the cost of
tolerating their depredations.
Few of these anarchic outposts last for very long.
The stronger and more active they become, the more
pressing it is for their victims to take steps to disperse
them. Barring some pirate king both charismatic and
foolhardy, most such outposts are primed for quick
abandonment when a fleet shows up on the sensors.

ADVENTURE CREATION
After developing one or more worlds, a GM ought to
have a fairly substantial list of Friends, Enemies, Places,
Complications, and Things appropriate to a given planet. An experienced GM may well be able to assemble
an interesting adventure out of these pieces, but even
the most practiced designer might be hard-pressed to
come up with enough interesting setups to fill out an
entire sector.
The method that follows is by no means the best
or only way to devise an adventure, but it’s a procedure
that will do the job for a working GM. This method
work best if you’ve already generated a world using
the tools in the Sector Creation chapter, but the basic
outlines can function even without such support.

Identify Your Needs

The first step in creating an adventure is identifying
what, precisely, you need the adventure to do. If you’ve
been following the recommended pattern for running
your campaign, the last session ended with you asking
the players what goal they wanted to pursue next time.
If this is for the first adventure to kick off a campaign,
you might need something that introduces the players
to the setting and gives them a short adventure to get
them working together smoothly. If you’re creating
backup content that you can deploy rapidly when the
players catch you off guard, then that might be a third
sort of purpose behind your work. Whatever it is, you
need to keep this basic goal in mind as you create the
adventure content. Adventures are created to be playable content at the table, so it needs to work for you.
Often, players are somewhat equivocal when they
tell you what sort of effort they plan to make for the
next session. Sometimes their intentions will be clear
and direct, such as pursuing a nemesis who got away
from them last time with a cargo hold full of alien artifacts. Other times, it will be something more nebulous,
like “Find a good deal on cargo for our ship” or “Explore
some of the alien ruins you mentioned were on this
world”, or “Do something really unkind to the planetary
duke who shot down our starship”.
When things are clear, you’ll have an easy time
creating an adventure. If they’re chasing the nemesis,
you know you need to create an adventure revolving
around them pursuing this evildoer and encountering
plausible challenges on the way. If the guidance you’ve
been given is less precise, more of the details are up to
you. You might create an adventure about a “bargain”
cargo deal that threatens to go very bad, or draw up an
alien ruin for them to explore, or introduce a plucky
band of anti-ducal rebels for the PCs to encounter,
along with the problems those rebels have. So long as
what you’re making is logically connected to what they
want from you, you’ll be able to deliver a fine time at
the table.

Sometimes, however, the players ask for something you know is going to be impossible, or something that you know will be rapidly reconsidered by
the group. Maybe the nemesis has fled into the bowels
of an ultra-high-security orbital citadel, or you know
that the duke is actually dying of biopsionic cancer and
will be dead in a few more days. If the information is
available to the PCs, you can point this out to them
and let them reconsider their goals. They might give
up on pursuing the nemesis, for example, or change
their goal to that of finding some way to penetrate the
defenses around the orbital station. It’s important not
to completely shut down impractical plans, but instead
suggest alternate routes that might turn “impossible”
into merely “very difficult”.
Be willing to follow the players’ lead on alternate
routes. If there’s not a compelling reason to shoot down
an idea or assumption about the world, run with it. If
they ask if there are rebels or traitors or spy networks
they might be able to contact to get the information
they need to crack the defenses, then tell them yes. If
the players are going to be kind enough to map out
your adventure creation needs for you, let them do the
work unless there’s a very good reason otherwise.
Other times, however, the players don’t have the
information they’d need to realize that their intentions
are impractical. You know they’re going to get ten minutes into the next session before they realize that what
they planned to do is totally impossible. You can’t write
them an adventure that gives them a chance of succeeding at the goal, not without violating common sense or
already-established game world facts, so what do you
do in such situations? There are two general ways to
handle this: anticipate their next course of action, or
prepare filler content.
There are times when you can tell that the players
are going to hit the obstacle and immediately look for
a way around it. Maybe they discover the nemesis has
fled to the orbital at the start of the next adventure,
but a convenient NPC suggests that there’s a way to
get the passcodes onto the station if the PCs are able
to contact a certain information broker. You write the
adventure to help you handle the PCs’ attempts to find
and convince the broker to help them, because you’re
confident that the group isn’t going to just shrug and
let the nemesis go.
On other occasions, however, you don’t have that
confidence. You really aren’t sure what the PCs will decide to do when they see their initial goal is impractical.
In this case, you write some filler content, designed to
give the players something fun to do for the session
while they figure out their next plan. This sort of filler
content can often be written far in advance of its actual
need, and over the course of a long campaign it’s likely
you’ll end up with several sessions worth of this prep

174• Adventure Creation
work kept ready in your GM folder, available for deployment whenever the PCs start doing things you’re
not prepared to handle yet. This section will include
some specific advice on how to build this kind of filler
content and how to insert it into play.
In the end, the goal at this stage is to have a clear
idea of what sort of content you need to have prepped
for the next session. Once you know what kind of material you need to make, you can go on to the next stage.

Choose Ingredients

The next step in creating the adventure is to look back
at your sector information and the tags and elements
you’ve rolled up for the planet the PCs are on. You’ve
already created some NPCs, complications, and places
to work with, so now’s your chance to take advantage
of your preparations. If the PCs are somewhere that
hasn’t had that work done already, take a moment to
fabricate an appropriate Friend, Enemy, Complication,
Thing, and Place suitable for the setting. You’ll use these
ingredients to create the adventure in the next step.
While you can pull the ingredients directly from
your sector file, you can also take a moment to customize them to the situation. Maybe there’s a particular
NPC you know is going to show up next time, given
the party’s ambitions, or there’s a specific macguffin
that’s in circulation right now. You can adjust these
ingredients to fit the specific circumstances and help
smooth transitions between adventures. The same people can keep showing up when it’s logical that they’d
be involved, and the other elements can persist to help
give a sense of continuity to events.
It’s also useful to pull in regular callbacks from
prior adventures. The things that PCs do have consequences, and sometimes those consequences persist for
quite some time. Try to put at least one callback to prior
events or people into each adventure, even if it’s just a
cameo from an NPC, or a newsflash giving up-to-date
reporting on some situation the PCs were involved in.
The more that the PCs feel like they’re really making
a difference in the campaign world, the more engaged
they’re going to be with the setting.
Try to make sure that the ingredients you use are
logical and coherent elements of your campaign setting.
Pulling antagonists or macguffins from the starry void
can be convenient, but an ingredient that just comes
out of nowhere, with no foreshadowing or visible connection to the rest of the campaign, is an ingredient
that some groups might find jarring and difficult to
interact with. In the absence of some visible connection to the rest of the campaign, it’s hard for a party
to get their hands around an ingredient and deduce
intelligent, rational ways to interact with it. A planetary
tyrant they’ve known about for a few sessions is much
easier to deal with than an alien overlord fresh out of
drillspace, because the tyrant is part of a setting and
context they’ve had a chance to understand.

Assemble the Outline

With the adventure ingredients in hand, it’s time to put
together the basic outline of the adventure. An outline
isn’t meant to fill in every detail and supply every fact
you need to run the adventure, but merely to give you
a basic idea of the adventure’s premise and point out
the kind of information you’ll need to prepare for play.
If you’re pressed for time and don’t feel like assembling your own outline, flip forward in this section
to a list of one hundred plot seeds. Take your Friends,
Enemies, Complications, and other world elements and
slot them into a seed that looks appropriate to your
needs. You now have your outline and can skip to the
next step in creating the adventure.
If you’d rather spend more time developing the
outline, you’ll want to pick three basic elements to
make up its essential frame. Not every adventure involves all three elements, but usually you’ll need representative examples of each. You’ll need a Problem to
drive the adventure, a Person to serve as an antagonist
or point of entry to the Problem, and you’ll need a Place
to set the events as they play out.
Your Problem is the core of your adventure, and
is an unstable or untenable situation that the PCs can
meaningfully affect. The players aren’t going to care
about problems so big or so intractable that their actions won’t have any consequential effect. They’re
going to be engaged with problems small enough, or
specific enough, that they feel that their choices can
really change the outcome.
Some Problems are self-attractive to the players. If
the party wants to explore an alien ruin on this world,
then simply putting an unexplored alien art museum
where they can get at it will be enticement enough. The
Problem is that the PCs want what’s inside the museum, but there are some dangers or difficulties that are
preventing them from plundering its age-old secrets.
Your job in that case will be to make the overcoming of
those difficulties interesting enough to satisfy the players. Whenever you have a situation where the players
want X, your Problem can simply consist of placing X
and then making it plausibly difficult to get to.
Other times, this isn’t going to be enough. Perhaps,
the planet’s savage water barons are locked in a bloody
struggle over control of the ancient Mandate-era hydroforming installation, control of which will leave
one of them the undisputed master of the arid world.
Certainly, the services of a small band of recklessly courageous adventurers could be vital in penetrating the
installation’s automatic defenses, but why should the
players care which tattooed savage gets to be master?
The Person is your way of connecting the players
with the Problem, when the Problem is not one that
naturally attracts their interest. The Person provides
the human connection between the party and the situation, either through being a sympathetic figure who
appeals to the group’s desire to help, or through being
a dangerous antagonist who forces a response.

Adventure Creation •175
Of course, an adventure can involve more than
one important NPC, and the players might end up with
multiple reasons to engage with the Problem. But by
focusing on at least one important Person, you make
sure that the players have a real reason to care about
the Problem and provide yourself with a contact point
through which to pass on information about the situation. Even an antagonist can serve as a useful chance
to dump setting info on the players and clue them in
to adventure opportunities. A blood-distilling water
baron who wipes out a sand village that helped the
party in an earlier adventure informs the players not
only that the water barons exist on the world, but that
this particular vampire warlord is on his way to seize
the hydroforming station.
At this stage, pick one Person to be the connection between the Problem and getting the PCs directly
involved. Give them a name and a sentence or so describing how they’re going to pull the PCs in, but don’t
worry about fleshing them out further at this point.
You might add additional people to the mix if you know
there are certain other NPCs you want to involve in the
situation, but you can delay this to the next step.
Finally, you need to choose a Place where this adventure is going to take place. Some sessions will occur
in multiple Places, with the heroes gallivanting around
the planet or solar system to deal with the Problem in
multiple locations, but every adventure needs at least
one Place to contain the action.
Sometimes the Place itself is the focus of the action. If the PCs are looting an alien art museum, then
the museum itself is going to be the major element of
importance in the adventure. You’re going to have to
make it a sufficiently interesting, complex, and engaging location to support a full session’s adventure.
Other times, the Place is just a backdrop to the action. A Problem involving tribal warfare in the steaming xeno-jungles of some gas giant moon might have
the terrain be a factor in things, but the jungle itself
is not expected to be interesting enough to keep the
players occupied with no further action. In these situations, the Place informs and shapes the Problem and
gives color and flavor to events, but you don’t have to
build it out into playable content by itself.
For now, define the Place that contains the Problem and make sure they’re connected in some way.
Even if the Place is just giving flavor and style cues to
the Problem, it should be clear to the players that whatever is going on here is a thing that is going on in this
particular Place. Make the tribal warfare the kind that
would occur in a jungle, with swift canoes fashioned of
giant beetle shells and ambushes that take advantage of
the perils of the alien jungle. The more the Place affects
what is happening, the more it matters to the game.
Once you’ve chosen a Problem to deal with, a
Person to connect the party with the situation, and a
Place where all of this is going to unfold, you’re ready
to move on to the next step in creating your adventure.

Fleshing It Out

You know the basic outline of the adventure, so this
stage is where you add the extra information you need
to actually play it out at the table. Some GMs need very
little of this, and can improvise an evening’s play out
of nothing more than an outline and a few sketched
notes. Most GMs require a little more preparation to
be comfortable with running an adventure. As you go
through this process, let your own comfort level be
your guide on how detailed and elaborate your preparation work should be, but make sure to cover the basic,
critical parts of the adventure first before you spend
time detailing contingencies and what-ifs.
To start the process, ask yourself the following
questions to determine what sort of preparation work
you need to do.
What maps do I need? If you expect the PCs to
assault a location, you’re going to need a map good
enough to support that. You can pull something close
off the web, scribble in any tweaks needed for your adventure, and use it accordingly. Maybe the abandoned
missile silo plans you’ve downloaded are actually being
used as a hidey-hole for a rebel leader, but all it takes
is a few coats of GM paint and the players won’t know
the difference.
The more carefully and intently the PCs are going
to be interacting with a site, the more you’re going to
need a map for it. A tense political meeting that takes
place on some orbital resort station might not need a
map at all if the focus is around the politics of it. If you
know a terrorist group is going to bomb the talks and
try to assassinate the diplomats, however, then you’re
going to need enough of a map to support the PCs’ inevitable attempts to foil or escape the bloodshed.
What places do I need to make interesting? This is
a special case that you’ll run into when the adventure
involves exploring a site. A simple diagram of a location is all you need to run a firefight there, but when
the thrust of the adventure involves plumbing the unknown mysteries of a site, there better be some halfway-decent mysteries there to plumb. There should be
perilous dangers, satisfying rewards, and interesting
gubbins to manipulate in the place, elements informed
by the map’s nature and origins. If the PCs are exploring a Chittik hive-station, they ought to be finding
things that make sense in the context of a man-eating
alien beetle home, while an abandoned Mandate control center should be full of the dusty relics of that lost
star-spanning human empire.
The art of creating an interesting site to explore is
worth a book in itself, but the tools later in this chapter
can help give you some ideas. Another useful source of
inspiration exists in countless old-school fantasy adventure modules; just dig through them for interesting setpieces, reskin them as super-science, and flavor
them with the style of whatever place they’re in. Never
hesitate to plunder existing content for your game. You
are but one GM, and your time and effort are finite.

176• Adventure Creation
What NPCs will I need to detail? When you detail an
NPC, you give them a hook, a motivation, a want, and
a power. The hook is simply some visual or behavioral
detail that will help them stick in the players’ memory. Reeking cigars, chrome-plated fingers, a habit of
finishing every sentence with ’you think?’, or any other unique detail can help the players remember them
when a name might slide off their recollections. These
hooks also give you a hint for descriptive detail when
you’re playing out an encounter with the PCs.
A motivation is simply that; what the NPC wants
from life, what immediate goal or ambition they have.
Often, this is related to the Problem; the NPC wants
a particular outcome from the situation. Sometimes
this is a broader life goal, like the desire for vast wealth,
or a particular person’s love, or revenge on an enemy.
A want is what they want specifically from the PCs.
Usually this is something that helps them achieve their
motivation, some assistance the PCs can give or action
they can take that will further the NPC’s motivation.
A power is what they can do to help or harm the PCs,
whether that consists of giving vital info, exerting their
influence for or against the PCs, or simply the threat
of their physical violence against the party. An NPC’s
power is why the PCs should care about their want.
Give the NPC combat statistics at this point if you
think it likely they’re going to get in a fight. Remember
that most people in the galaxy are normal human beings with no unique combat prowess. Just because an
NPC is the president of a megacorp doesn’t necessarily
mean he’s got more than 1 hit die, especially if he’s
led a life otherwise insulated from physical danger and
threats to his life.
What default outcomes will you need to establish?
In an unstable situation, it’s assumed that events will
shake out a certain way if the PCs don’t get involved,
or don’t try to redirect events a particular way. Take
a moment to decide what’s going to happen in the adventure if the players don’t change things. How will
the situation resolve itself, and what will happen to the
NPCs involved? If there’s a particular timeline to the
adventure, when certain things will happen at certain
times, note it down.
If the adventure is especially time-sensitive, make
sure the PCs are given adequate warning about it.
While the party might reasonably be expected to understand that a tribal assault on a fortified desert community isn’t going to continue forever, if the town is going
to collapse in three hours then they need to know that
every minute counts. Let NPCs warn them of the dwindling resistance, let the enemies make visible progress
toward success, and otherwise ensure that the natural
warnings inherent in the situation are properly passed
on to the players. They can’t realize how serious a situation is if the GM won’t tell them what their PCs can see.
What are the rewards to dealing with the Problem?
You need to figure out what exactly the PCs are supposed to be getting out of their efforts. If they’re plun-

dering an alien treasure-house, what exactly are they
going to find there? If they save the desert community,
what kind of help or reward do they receive? Is there
some way that solving this Problem will advance a PC’s
personal goals? Sometimes the reward of a situation is
simply avoiding some terrible outcome, but too many
of these charity jobs or self-defense adventures can
leave the players feeling like chumps.
Determining the rewards in experience points,
cash, or plunder can be delicate, so there’s a separate
section in this chapter devoted to helping you do just
that. Your choice will depend largely on how quickly
you want the PCs to advance in personal power and
how plausible it is that a given situation might offer a
considerable reward.
Lastly, how will the PCs get involved? You’ve got a
Person to hook them in, or the Problem itself is attractive to the PCs, but how exactly are you going to
connect the players to the adventure? Figure out the
details of how you’re going to introduce the adventure to the players and take note of the information,
resources, and situation they’ll encounter when they
step into the scenario.

Polish It Up

You’re almost finished with your adventure. All you
need to do now is put yourself in your party’s shoes
and think about how they’re likely to experience the
adventure. You know your players better than any
author could, so you know the ways they’re likely to
react to NPCs, how they like to deal with problems,
and what sort of things make them sympathetic or angry. Don’t worry about some platonic Ideal Adventurer
when you’re doing a mental walkthrough of the adventure. Worry about the people you know are going to
be playing this.
If you’ve created a sandbox-style adventure with
the steps above, there won’t be any written-out “path”
through the adventure. You’ll have a situation, some
NPCs, and the resources you need to handle the players
interacting with that situation. Maybe they’ll resolve
it to their liking, and maybe they’ll end the session by
booking a fast ship offplanet with a furious mob at their
heels. Your only concern at this stage is making sure
the adventure is logical, approachable, and engaging.
Is the adventure logical? If your adventure is contradicting facts that have already been established about
the world, the players are going to want to see a good
reason for it. If they break into a slum warehouse to
find it full of elite special-ops combatants, they’re going
to want a very good explanation for such a seemingly-irrational encounter. They don’t have to see every
explanation or understand every dramatic deviation
from reasonable expectations, but you should know
these reasons, and the players should be confident that
the reasons exist.
If you design an adventure by “story logic”, where
the most important thing is maintaining a genre feel

Adventure Creation •177
and good adventure pacing, the players are going to
react in story-logical ways. When presented with an
obstacle, they’re going to assume that their heroes are
expected to have a reasonable chance to overcome
that obstacle. When faced with a dangerous combat
foe, they’re going to assume the enemy is at least theoretically beatable by the group, and when encountering a seemingly-invincible challenge, they’re going to
look around for the right story levers to pull to make
it somewhat more vincible. This style of running a
game is perfectly valid, and it is indeed preferable for
groups that want to maintain a certain genre feel, but
it’s not usually how Stars Without Number adventures
get made.
The default Stars Without Number assumption is
that adventures operate on established setting logic. If
something should be somewhere, it is, whether or not
the PCs can hope to overcome it. If an ally is locked
away in the bowels of a max-security prison, the PCs
might simply not have any reasonable way to get them
out unless they can change the situation through supplemental adventures. When the PCs see a terrifyingly
dangerous foe, that foe really is terrifyingly dangerous,
and some PCs are almost certainly going to die if they
decide to fight. The PCs have no cosmic authorial protection, and if they put themselves in no-win situations,
they are going to lose.
With that in mind, look at your adventure and
make sure it is not the sort of challenge or situation
that would only be essayed by someone convinced that
they are the first-book protagonist of a sci-fi trilogy.
Don’t expect the PCs to do unreasonable things or face
ridiculous obstacles just because they’re part of the adventure. A canny player group will make a point of
avoiding unjustified perils and staying well clear of unbeatable difficulties. They won’t bite on your adventure
if it seems a fast-track journey to an unmarked grave.
Is the adventure approachable? This has to do with
your hook and the overall appeal of the situation. What
is it about this situation that’s going to pique player
interest? Knowing what you know about your players,
is this the sort of thing they’re going to jump into? Even
if you’re confident that the players will want to get involved, you need to make sure they have a clear way
into the situation. If it’s a roil of political intrigue, give
them somebody to contact. If it’s a mysterious alien
ruin, give them a map to it.
It’s not your job to develop a clear route through
the adventure, a step-by-step sequence of events that
can predictably lead to success. It is, however, your job
to give the PCs a way to get involved in the situation.
If you can’t see an obvious “first step” to the adventure,
then it’s unlikely your players will be able to see one.
Is the adventure engaging? An adventure which
is about something fundamentally uninteresting to the
players is just not going to hold their attention. Good
sports will try to get through it simply because it’s what
you created for them, but other players will start play-

ing with their phones, talking about extraneous matters, or just doing something else in-game. Even if the
PCs have a logical reason to care about the adventure,
if the players are not invested, they aren’t going to have
a very good time.
To build engagement, use elements your players
love and elements your players hate. What do your
players really like? What kind of NPCs, situations, and
activities do they really enjoy? Don’t worry about abstract players, just think about the specific people you
are playing with. Conversely, what kind of villains do
they absolutely despise? What sort of evildoing gets
them fired up with righteous wrath? It’s important
not to push things into gratuitous grimdark, but if you
have some players who really hate slavers, then that’s
a good cue to make beating down slavers an element
in an adventure.
Once you’ve polished up the adventure, done a
mental walk-through of events, and ensured that it is
logical, approachable, and engaging, then you’re ready
to play.

Creating Filler Adventures

Sometimes a GM gets caught flat-footed by the players.
They do something or choose a goal that the GM is
totally unprepared to manage. A GM is well within
their rights to call a pause and explain to the players
that they’re just not ready to handle that yet, and if the
players want to do it, they can do it next session, after
the GM has had time to prep something for it.
Other times, however, the GM will just throw in
a quick filler adventure. These are adventures built expressly for running when the GM is caught by surprise
or runs out of prepared content for the evening. Filler
adventures are built much like any other adventure, but
their priorities are different. Filler adventures should
be insistent, short, and simple.
The adventure needs to be insistent; it needs to
present a situation that the PCs absolutely must deal
with right this minute. A terrorist attack, a criminal
stealing a PC macguffin, a friend frantically calling for
help… the adventure needs to grab the PCs and distract
them from whatever it was they were trying to do.
Even so, the adventure should be short. A filler
adventure shouldn’t take longer to complete than it
takes for you to come up with a good response to the
players’ initial goal. You just need to keep the players
entertained long enough for you to figure out what
you’re going to do, so a filler adventure shouldn’t eat
up more than a session at most.
Lastly, the adventure should be simple. Don’t burn
yourself out on complex entanglements and relations
to the existing adventure. If you can come up with a
good tie-in quickly, great, but the ideal filler adventure
is general enough to slot in almost anywhere.
Unused bits and pieces of your regular adventures
can be used as filler components. Don’t waste your
work; if the PCs haven’t seen it, save it for later use.

178• Adventure Rewards

Adventure Rewards
Player characters all have their own reasons for seeking
adventure in the trackless void, but pragmatic rewards
of wealth, power, and influence tend to be popular.
When designing your adventures, how should you apportion rewards, whether in experience points, pretech
artifacts, or credits?

Rewarding Credits

The first thing to understand about the credit economy in your campaign is that “too much money” is not
a significant problem to have. Unlike many types of
games, there’s really nothing the PCs can do with large
amounts of money that will allow them to drastically improve their own personal power. They can hire
minions, they can buy starships, they can get cyberware,
and they can use their wealth as a bludgeon of influence,
but at the end of the day they still basically have the
same character sheet as before.
In the same vein, in a sandbox campaign there is
no storyline to disrupt. If the PCs suddenly luck into
a stellar tyrant’s ransom, then the campaign is about
what they do with the money. Maybe it lets them casually crush the problems they used to have, but now
they’ve got an entirely new set of concerns befitting
their newfound wealth. Unless the PCs simply decide
to stop adventuring after a lucky strike, their future
campaign sessions will simply be flavored with great
wealth and the problems and possibilities that come
along with it.
So don’t worry about “keeping the PCs hungry”.
Just let them acquire the logical amount of money that
their deeds and situation would earn them. If they do
a significant favor for a megacorp CEO, they should be
earning a lot more than they’d get from the heartfelt
gratitude of a lostworlder peasant whose life they saved.
With that in mind, here’s an adjacent list of reasonable credit amounts that can be applied to adventures.
If the PCs do work for someone, they’ll get paid to the
extent that they earned it and the patron can afford it.
If they come across lost loot or valuable cargo, you can
use these numbers to gauge what a “big haul” would be
to most people in the setting.

Rewarding Ships and Major Items

Most groups are going to want to get their own starship
relatively early on in the campaign. You might even
have the acquisition of a beaten-up merchant ship be
the result of the introductory adventure. While it’s
certainly possible for a sci-fi campaign to spend most
of its time on a single world or for PCs to hitch rides
with allies and existing transport ships, most players
are going to want to get their own set of thrusters.
The basic guideline for rewarding a ship or any
other major piece of hardware is that it’s going to take
at least one session of adventure to get it, assuming you

Reward Type

Slum dweller’s maximum funds
A lot of money to an ordinary worker
Ordinary worker’s maximum funds
A lot of money to an affluent person

think it’s reasonable to allow it in the first place. The
PCs are going to have to come up with a plan or look
for an opportunity to grab the thing they want if they
don’t have the money to buy it outright.
You can use this principle when the PCs want
anything, whether it’s a ship, a particular ally, a base
of operations, or anything else that can’t reasonably
buy. Make them adventure for it. You can give them
suggestions and ideas, but it’s up to them to come up
with a plan for getting their hands on what they want.
Once they’ve done that, all you need to do is make
up an adventure revolving around their efforts, and
you’ve got your evening’s entertainment. As always,
you should be watchful for opportunities to make PC
ambitions into easy adventure outlines.

Rewarding Experience Points

There are several different methods to award experience points. The one you choose will depend largely on
the kind of campaign you want to run and the speed of
advancement you want for the PCs.
The basic experience award for each member of
a party is three points. This assumes a fairly fast rate
of advancement, with PCs reaching second level after
their first award. If you want a slower one, drop it to
two points, or even one. All members of the group
should get the same basic award unless you want PCs
of different levels in your group.
When do you hand out this basic award? You have
several different choices.
Use a session-based system. Hand out the award at
the end of every gaming session, assuming the PCs
were trying to accomplish something worthy of their

Adventure Rewards •179

skills. Parties that coast along without facing any real
challenges might not receive the award.
Use a personal goal-based system. Have every PC list
at least one long-term goal and one short-term goal.
If they achieve a short-term goal during the session,
give them a basic award. If they manage to succeed at
a long-term goal, give them triple that amount of experience. Different characters can share the same goals if
they wish, and it’s up to the GM to decide whether or
not a particular goal is challenging enough to deserve
a reward. PCs can pick new goals or change old ones
at the end of each session.
Note that if you use this method different PCs will
advance at different rates, depending on how often they
reach their goals. This isn’t a problem if the group is
fine with it, and if PCs work to make sure the party
isn’t focusing too much on the goals of only a few members. If you want to help encourage spreading the focus
around, you can rule that no PC can get goal XP again
until someone else in the group has achieved a goal.
Use a mission-based system. Have the group agree
on a mission or goal at the end of each session or at the
start of the campaign. When the group reaches that
goal, they all get an experience award. They can choose
to change their goal at the end of every session, or pick
a new one if they’ve attained their original purpose. If
they choose a particularly hard mission they might get
an extra bonus, at the cost of a greater risk of failure.

Use a loot-based system. This sort of campaign
doesn’t use experience points. Instead, it uses cash.
Every PC needs to earn 5,000 credits of liquid funds
in rewards or loot before reaching second level. Then
they need to earn 10,000 more to reach third, 20,000
more to reach fourth, and so on, with the new amount
needed doubling at each level. Only wealth they’ve
earned adventuring and converted into spendable credits counts toward this amount. Once a PC gains a level,
their running “score” is reset to zero, and even huge
hauls can’t boost them more than one level at a time.
This experience method strongly incentivizes
ruthless plundering, and might result in uneven advancement if the party doesn’t split their earnings evenly. It does make for a laser-focused game of freebooting
avarice, however.
Use a spending-based system. This works the same
way as the loot-based system, but the credits they earn
only count if the PC spends them. Credits spent on personal equipment, cyberware, vehicles, or other directly
useful items don’t count. Only credits “wasted” in revelry, charity, supporting some NPC cause, building a
power base, or otherwise interacting with the game
world count toward the PC’s advancement.
This, too, can result in a party with PCs of varying character level over time, as some choose to buy
hardware and others elect to “waste” the money. It does
encourage a great deal of engagement, however.

180• Problems

Creating Problems
Every Problem boils down to a fundamental conflict. A
person wants something and they can’t have it, or they
don’t want something and are being forced to accept
it, or they have something and it’s being threatened, or
they want something and someone else wants it too. At
the bottom of every Problem there’s a conflict the PCs
can engage. These tables on these two pages provide
some cues for generating Problems for your adventures.
First, roll 1d8, 1d10, and 1d10 on the Conflict
Type table on the opposite page. The first roll gives
you an idea of the general type of conflict at the bottom
of the adventure. It might be a matter of money, old
grudges, a natural catastrophe, ethnic struggles, or one
of several other root causes. You can stop at this point
if the cue is sufficiently inspirational.
Otherwise, the next roll gives you the overall situation of the conflict. This is the backdrop to the adventure, and while the PCs may not be able to resolve the
entire conflict, they should be able to make a difference
in this particular skirmish. You can take this general
context and decide on a specific event or situation that’s
causing the conflict at the heart of the Problem.
If further inspiration is needed, the third roll gives
you a specific focus for the Problem. Something is happening, and there are at least two sides involved; one
that is in favor of what is happening, and one that is

opposed. Just put forces on both sides of the focus and
you’ll have your starting Problem.
Some Problems have the PCs on one of the sides.
If “Money was stolen from someone” and “The PCs are
owed it”, then the PCs themselves will have a powerful
incentive to involve themselves in the conflict. Other
Problems only have people on one side; if there’s a catastrophic natural disaster, the disaster itself is unlikely
to have motivations or goals, while the hapless victims
doubtless are struggling to survive.
To add further decoration to the circumstances,
you can roll on the tables below. The Restraint table
gives you a reason why the conflict hasn’t boiled over
yet, and why the PCs might be a wildcard that can resolve the problem at hand. Some Problems can keep
a long time with a sufficiently stern Restraint, which
makes them convenient when you need to make filler
adventures that can stay in storage until you need them.
The Twist table gives you a turn you can add to
the Problem, something to complicate the situation and
shake up easy assumptions about how it will play out.
At all times, you should be looking for chances to
insert elements you’ve already created for this world.
Use Enemies for antagonists, Friends for allies, and
slip in Complications when you need additional twists.
GMing is tough enough without making extra work.

Creating People
You’ll need People to help the PCs get involved in your
adventure and to flesh out the personalities and important figures in the Problem. Not every NPC needs
to be worked up fully, but it can be convenient to have
a few spare People around to drop in when the players
suddenly take an interest in a bit-player NPC you never
expected they’d focus on.
To generate a Person, start with their motivation.
This is what the Person wants out of life, their major
focus and drive. The deals they offer and the actions
they take should revolve around this motivation. Different people will go to different extremes to follow
this motivation, so you shouldn’t feel obligated to make
it a monomania for them, but it’s the basic driver of
their actions.
Next, pick a want. This is the immediate thing the
NPC thinks will most effectively advance their motivation. If the latter is “Promote a friend or offspring’s
career” and the want is “Burn down or destroy a particular structure”, then you simply have to figure out how
burning down that place is going to advance the NPC’s
daughter’s career. The want is what the NPC is most
likely to desire the PCs to help them achieve.
Now determine their power. This is what the
NPC can use to pay off the PCs or threaten them into
compliance. If a Person hasn’t got any power to help
d20

Initial Manner

or harm the party, the PCs aren’t going to have much
motivation to care about their wants. Not every NPC
will have much power, but they should all be able to do
something to help or hinder the PCs.
Then you determine a hook, a visual or character
quirk that will help you describe them during play and
help the players remember who they are.
Lastly, if you want to make life a little easier for
yourself, you can roll or pick an initial manner of
approach and a default deal outcome for the Person.
These additional tables help smooth out the handling
of PC deals and negotiations with the NPC.
The initial manner is simply how the NPC will
deal with the PCs during their initial meeting. Maybe
they’ll be effusively appreciative of the party’s capabilities, or maybe they’ll be full of thin-lipped disapproval,
but their manner can give you some cues for playing
out the NPC’s interactions with the party.
The default deal outcome can give you a cue as to
how or if the NPC will keep any deal they make with
the PCs. In some cases, you’ll already know whether
or not the NPC will play fair with the party, either because you know they’re essentially trustworthy people
or you know they’re double-dipped bastards. The table
is convenient when you’re not quite sure if an NPC is
as good as their word.

184• Places

Creating Places
Places can be very simple to create or very complex. If
a Place is only needed as a backdrop for events and you
don’t expect the PCs to spend much time exploring it,
you really don’t need anything more than a name and
a few sentences of description for the table. If it’s to be
an alien ruin, enemy base, or some other structure that
the PCs are going to carefully interact with, you’ll need
something more interesting.
For the former type of place, just pull an appropriate Place from the world generation data you’ve already
created. You can then give it some background activity
from the table below. If it’s an urban, civilized sort of
location, you can roll for a Civilized Ongoing to indicate what’s happening there right now. If it’s a lost ruin,
wilderness glade, or other wild place, roll or pick from
the Wilderness Ongoings list.
If the PCs plan to investigate the place, you’ll want
a Reward to determine what worthwhile thing the PCs
might find there. In some cases, you’ll already know
what the Reward should be; if the PCs are going into
an alien ruin to dig out a lost macguffin, then the macguffin itself will be the reward. You can still use the
Reward table to create some secondary loot prospects
in the place if you wish, the better to reward careful
exploration and creative overcoming of the area’s inevitable hazards.
d20

Reward

Those hazards can be derived from the opposite
table. The first roll gives a general type of hazard that
the PCs will have to face in an area or sub-area of the
Place, while the specific examples and possible dangers
provide more concrete suggestions.
You can apply these hazards to specific parts of
the Place, or if the area is too small to sustain much
mayhem, you might roll once and apply it generally to
the entire location.
One of the easiest ways to quickly produce an interesting area to explore is to go online and loot the
web for old-school-style fantasy adventure modules.
In many cases, the maps and floor plans can be stolen
outright, while the room contents can be reskinned
with suitably sci-fi flavor. Most of these old adventures
use game mechanics that are similar to those used by
Stars Without Number, such as hit points, Armor Classes, damage rolls, and gold piece values that can easily
be converted to credits. If you mix and match these
components, using pieces from multiple adventures to
stitch together what you need, even those players who
might have experienced the original adventure won’t
be able to recognize your handiwork.
This principle of constructive looting is important
to any sandbox GM. Save creative energy for where it
counts. Everywhere else, plunder without shame.

186• Adventure Seeds

Adventure Seeds
The hundred ideas that follow are basic outlines for
various adventures. Just take the components you’ve
rolled for a given planet, slot them in the spaces noted
in the adventure seeds, and build out from there to
create an evening’s entertainment.
If you want something more complicated than
these basic seeds provide, you can string several of
them together, gluing them into a single perilous circumstance to occupy the heroes.
As a general rule of thumb, a single seed should
occupy the group for a single session’s worth of adventure. If you need to create more content than that, you
can scale events by adding additional complications or
breaking the adventure up into several additional tasks
or obstacles that must be overcome before the PCs can
successfully resolve it.
1. An Enemy seeks to rob a Friend of some precious
Thing that he has desired for some time.
2. A Thing has been discovered on property owned
by a Friend, but a Complication risks its destruction.
3. A Complication suddenly hits the party while
they’re out doing some innocuous activity.
4. The players unwittingly offend or injure an Enemy,
incurring his or her wrath. A Friend offers help in
escaping the consequences.
5. Rumor speaks of the discovery of a precious Thing
in a distant Place. The players must get to it before
an Enemy does.
6. An Enemy has connections with offworld pirates
or slavers, and a Friend has been captured by them.
7. A Place has been seized by violent revolutionaries
or rebels, and a Friend is being held hostage by
them.
8. A Friend is in love with someone forbidden by social convention, and the two of them need help
eloping.
9. An Enemy wields tyrannical power over a Friend,
relying on the bribery of corrupt local officials to
escape consequences.
10. A Friend has been lost in hostile wilderness, and
the party must reach a Place to rescue them in the
teeth of a dangerous Complication.
11. An Enemy has committed a grave offense against a
PC or their family sometime in the past. A Friend
shows the party a weakness in the Enemy’s defenses.
12. The party is suddenly caught in a conflict between
two warring families or political parties.
13. The party is framed for a crime by an Enemy, and
must reach the sanctuary of a Place before they can
regroup and find the Thing that will prove their
innocence and their Enemy’s perfidy.

14. A Friend is threatened by a tragedy of sickness, legal calamity, or public humiliation, and the only
one that seems able to save them is an Enemy.
15. A natural disaster or similar Complication strikes
a Place while the party is present, causing great
loss of life and property unless the party is able to
immediately respond to the injured and trapped.
16. A Friend with a young business has struck a cache
of pretech, valuable minerals, or precious salvage.
He needs the party to help him reach the Place
where the valuables are.
17. An oppressed segment of society starts a sudden
revolt in the Place the party is occupying. An Enemy simply lumps the party in with the rebels and
tries to put the revolt down with force. A Friend
offers them a way to either help the rebels or clear
their names.
18. A vulnerable Friend has been targeted for abduction, and has need of guards. A sudden Complication makes guarding them from the Enemy seeking
their kidnapping much more difficult. If the Friend
is snatched, they must rescue them from a Place.
19. A mysterious Place offers the promise of some
precious Thing, but access is very dangerous due
to wildlife, hostile locals, or a dangerous environment.
20. An Enemy and a Friend both have legal claim on
a Thing, and seek to undermine each other’s case.
The Enemy is willing to do murder if he thinks he
can get away with it.
21. An Enemy seeks the death of his brother, a Friend,
by arranging the failure of his grav flyer or shuttlecraft in dangerous terrain while the party is coincidentally aboard. The party must survive the
environment and bring proof of the crime out
with them.
22. A Friend seeks to slip word to a lover, one who is
also being courted by the Friend’s brother, who
is an Enemy. A Complication threatens to cause
death or disgrace to the lover unless they either
accept the Enemy’s suit or are helped by the party.
23. An Enemy is convinced that one of the party has
committed adultery with their flirtatious spouse.
He means to lure them to a Place, trap them, and
have them killed by the dangers there.
24. An Enemy has been driven insane by exotic recreational drugs or excessive psionic torching. He
fixes on a PC as being his mortal nemesis, and
plots elaborate deaths, attempting to conceal his
involvement amid Complications.
25. A Friend has stolen a precious Thing from an Enemy and fled into a dangerous, inaccessible Place.
The party must rescue them, and decide what to do
with the Thing and the outraged Enemy.

Adventure Seeds •187
26. An Enemy has realized that their brother or sister
has engaged in a socially unacceptable affair with
a Friend, and means to kill both of them unless
stopped by the party.
27. A Friend has accidentally caused the death of a
family member, and wants the party to help him
hide the body or fake an accidental death before
his family realizes what has happened. A Complication suddenly makes the task more difficult.
28. A Friend is a follower of a zealous ideologue who
plans to make a violent demonstration of the
righteousness of his cause, causing a social Complication. The Friend will surely be killed in the
aftermath if not rescued or protected by the party.
29. A Friend’s sibling is to be placed in a dangerous
situation they’ve got no chance of surviving. The
Friend takes their place at the last moment, and
will almost certainly die unless the party aids them.
30. Suicide bombers detonate an explosive, chemical,
or biological weapon in a Place occupied by the
party where a precious Thing is stored The PCs
must escape before the Place collapses on top of
them, navigating throngs of terrified people in the
process and saving the Thing if possible.
31. An Enemy who controls landing permits, oxygen
rations, or some other important resource has a
prejudice against one or more of the party members. He demands that they bring him a Thing
from a dangerous Place before he’ll give them the
goods.
32. A Friend in a loveless marriage to an Enemy seeks
escape to be with their beloved, and contacts the
party to snatch them from their spouse’s guards at
a prearranged Place.
33. A Friend seeks to elope with their lover, and contacts the party to help them meet their paramour
at a remote, dangerous Place. On arrival, they find
that the lover is secretly an Enemy desirous of their
removal and merely lured them to the place to
meet their doom.
34. The party receives or finds a Thing which proves
the crimes of an Enemy- yet a Friend was complicit
in the crimes, and will be punished as well if the
authorities are involved. And the Enemy will stop
at nothing to get the item back.
35. A Friend needs to get to a Place on time in order to
complete a business contract, but an Enemy means
to delay and hinder them until it’s too late, inducing Complications to the trip.
36. A locked pretech stasis pod has been discovered by
a Friend, along with directions to the hidden keycode that will open it. The Place where the keycode
is hidden is now owned by an Enemy.
37. A fierce schism has broken out in the local majority
religion, and an Enemy is making a play to take
control of the local hierarchy. A Friend is on the
side that will lose badly if the Enemy succeeds, and
needs a Thing to prove the other group’s error.

38. A former Enemy has been given reason to repent
his treatment of a Friend, and secretly commissions them to help the Friend overcome a Complication. A different Enemy discovers the connection, and tries to paint the PCs as double agents.
39. An alien or a human with extremely peculiar spiritual beliefs seeks to visit a Place for their own reasons. An Enemy of their own kind attempts to stop
them before they can reach the Place, and reveal
the Thing that was hidden there long ago.
40. A Friend’s sibling is an untrained psychic, and has
been secretly using his or her powers to protect
the Friend from an Enemy. The neural damage
has finally overwhelmed their sanity, and they’ve
now kidnapped the Friend to keep them safe. The
Enemy is taking this opportunity to make sure
the Friend “dies at the hands of their maddened
sibling”.
41. A Friend who is a skilled precognitive has just received a flash of an impending atrocity to be committed by an Enemy. He or she needs the party
to help them steal the Thing that will prove the
Enemy’s plans while dodging the assassins sent to
eliminate the precog.
42. A Friend who is an exotic dancer is sought by an
Enemy who won’t take no for an answer. The
dancer is secretly a Perimeter agent attempting to
infiltrate a Place to destroy maltech research, and
plots to use the party to help get him or her into
the facility under the pretext of striking at the Enemy.
43. A young woman on an interplanetary tour needs
the hire of local bodyguards. She turns out to be a
trained and powerful combat psychic, but touchingly naive about local dangers, causing a social
Complication that threatens to get the whole
group arrested.
44. A librarian Friend has discovered an antique databank with the coordinates of a long-lost pretech
cache hidden in a Place sacred to a long-vanished
religion. The librarian is totally unsuited for danger, but necessary to decipher the obscure religious
iconography needed to unlock the cache. The
cache is not the anticipated Thing, but something
more dangerous to the finder.
45. A fragment of orbital debris clips a shuttle on the
way in, and the spaceport is seriously damaged in
the crash. The player’s ship or the only vessel capable of getting them off-planet will be destroyed
unless the players can organize a response to the
dangerous chemical fires and radioactives contaminating the port. A Friend is trapped somewhere
in the control tower wreckage.
46. A Friend is allied with a reformist religious group
that seeks to break the grip of the current, oppressive hierarchy. The current hierarchs have a great
deal of political support with the authorities, but
the commoners resent them bitterly. The Friend

188• Adventure Seeds
seeks to secure a remote Place as a meeting-place
for the theological rebels.
47. A microscopic black hole punctures an orbital station or starship above the world. Its interaction
with the station’s artificial grav generators has
thrown everything out of whack, and the station’s become a minefield of dangerously high or
zero grav zones. It’s tearing itself apart, and it’s
going to collapse soon. An Enemy seeks to escape
aboard the last lifeboat and to Hell with everyone
else. Meanwhile, a Friend is trying to save his engineer daughter from the radioactive, grav-unstable
engine rooms.
48. The planet has a sealed alien ruin, and an Enemy-led cult who worships the vanished builders.
They’re convinced that they have the secret to
opening and controlling the power inside the ruins, but they’re only half-right. A Friend has found
evidence that shows that they’ll only devastate the
planet if they meddle with the alien power planet.
The party has to get inside the ruins and shut down
the engines before it’s too late. Little do they realize that a few aliens survive inside, in a stasis field
that will be broken by the ruin’s opening.
49. An Enemy and the group are suddenly trapped in
a Place during an accident or Complication. They
must work together to escape in time.
50. A telepathic Friend has discovered that an Enemy
was responsible for a recent atrocity. Telepathic
evidence is useless on this world, however, and if
she’s discovered to have scanned his mind she’ll be
lobotomized as a ’rogue psychic’. A Thing might
be enough to prove his guilt, if the party can figure out how to get to it without revealing their
Friend’s meddling.
51. A Friend is responsible for safeguarding a Thingyet the Thing is suddenly proven to be a fake. The
party must find the real object and the Enemy who
stole it or else their Friend will be punished as the
thief.
52. A Friend is bitten by a poisonous local animal
while in a remote Place. The only antidote is back
at civilization, yet a Complication threatens to delay the group until it is too late.
53. A lethal plague has started among the residents of
the town, but a Complication is keeping aid from
reaching them. An Enemy is taking advantage of
the panic to hawk a fake cure at ruinous prices,
and a Friend is taken in by him. The Complication
must be overcome before help can reach the town.
54. A radical political party has started to institute
pogroms against “groups hostile to the people”. A
Friend is among those groups, and needs to get out
of town before an Enemy uses the riot as cover to
settle old scores.
55. An Enemy has sold the party an expensive but
worthlessly flawed piece of equipment before

lighting out for the back country. He and his plunder are holed up at a remote Place.
56. A concert of offworld music is being held in town,
and a Friend is slated to be the star performer. Reactionary elements led by an Enemy plot to ruin
the “corrupting noise” with sabotage that risks
getting performers killed. Meanwhile, a crowd
of ignorant offworlder fans have landed and are
infuriating the locals.
57. An Enemy is wanted on a neighboring world for
some heinous act, and a Friend turns up as a bounty hunter ready to bring him in alive. This world
refuses to extradite him, so the capture and retrieval has to evade local law enforcement.
58. An unanticipated solar storm blocks communications and grounds the poorly-shielded grav vehicle
that brought the group to this remote Place. Then
people start turning up dead; the storm has awoken a dangerous Enemy beast.
59. A Friend has discovered a partially-complete schematic for an ancient pretech refinery unit that produces vast amounts of something precious on this
world- water, oxygen, edible compounds, or the
like. Several remote Places on the planet are indicated as having the necessary pretech spare parts
required to build the device. When finally assembled, embedded self-modification software in the
Thing modifies itself into a pretech combat bot.
The salvage from it remains very valuable.
60. A Complication ensnares the party where they are
in an annoying but seemingly ordinary event. In
actuality, an Enemy is using it as cover to strike at
a Friend or Thing that happens to be where the
PCs are.
61. A Friend has a cranky, temperamental artificial
heart installed, and the doctor who put it in is the
only one who really understands how it works.
The heart has recently started to stutter, but the
doctor has vanished. An Enemy has snatched him
to fit his elite assassins with very unsafe combat
mods.
62. A local clinic is doing wonders in providing free
health care to the poor. In truth, it’s a front for
an offworld eugenics cult, with useful “specimens”
kidnapped and shipped offworld while ’cremated remains’ are given to the family. A Friend is
snatched by them, but the party knows they’d
have never consented to cremation as the clinic
staff claim.
63. Space pirates have cut a deal with an isolated
backwoods settlement, off loading their plunder
to merchants who meet them there. A Friend goes
home to family after a long absence, but is kidnapped or killed before they can bring back word
of the dealings. Meanwhile, the party is entrusted
with a valuable Thing that must be brought to the
Friend quickly.

Adventure Seeds •189
64. A reclusive psychiatrist is offering treatment for
violent mentally ill patients at a remote Place. His
treatments seem to work, calming the subjects
and returning them to rationality, though major
memory loss is involved and some severe social
clumsiness ensues. In actuality, he’s removed
large portions of their brains to fit them with remote-control units slaved to an AI in his laboratory. He intends to use them as drones to acquire
more “subjects”, and eventual control of the town.
65. Vital medical supplies against an impending plague
have been shipped in from offworld, but the spike
drive craft that was due to deliver them misjumped,
and has arrived in-system as a lifeless wreck transmitting a blind distress signal. Whoever gets there
first can hold the whole planet hostage, and an Enemy means to do just that.
66. A Friend has spent a substantial portion of their
wealth on an ultra-modern new domicile, and invites the party to enjoy a weekend there. An Enemy has hacked the house’s computer system to
trap the inhabitants inside and use the automated
fittings to kill them.
67. A mud slide, hurricane, earthquake, or other form
of disaster strikes a remote settlement. The party
is the closest group of responders, and must rescue
the locals while dealing with the unearthed, malfunctioning pretech Thing that threatens to cause
an even greater calamity if not safely defused.
68. A Friend has found a lost pretech installation, and
needs help to loot it. By planetary law, the contents
belong to the government.
69. An Enemy mistakes the party for the kind of offworlders who will murder innocents for pay- assuming they aren’t that kind, at least. He’s sloppy
with the contact and unwittingly identifies himself,
letting the players know that a Friend will shortly
die unless the Enemy is stopped.
70. A party member is identified as a prophesied savior
for an oppressed faith or ethnicity. The believers
obstinately refuse to believe any protestations to
the contrary, and a cynical Enemy in government
decides the PC must die simply to prevent the risk
of uprising. An equally cynical Friend is determined to push the PC forward as a savior, because
that’s what’s needed.
71. Alien beasts escape from a zoo and run wild
through the spectators. The panicked owner offers
large rewards for recapturing them live, but some
of the beasts are quite dangerous.
72. A trained psychic is accused of going feral by an
Enemy. The psychic had already suffered severe
neural damage before being found for training,
so brain scans cannot establish physical signs of
madness. The psychic seems unstable, but not violent- at least, on short acquaintance. The psychic
offers a psychic PC the secrets of a unique psychic
technique if they help him flee.

73. A Thing is the token of rulership on this world,
and it’s gone missing. If it’s not found rapidly, the
existing ruler will be deposed. Evidence left at a
Place suggests that an Enemy has it, but extralegal
means are necessary to investigate fully.
74. Psychics are vanishing, including a Friend. They’re
being kidnapped by an ostensibly-rogue government researcher who is using them to research the
lost psychic disciplines that helped enable pretech
manufacturing, and they are being held at a remote
Place. The snatcher is a small-time local Enemy
with unnaturally ample resources.
75. A Friend desperately seeks to hide evidence of some
past crime that will ruin his life should it come to
light. An Enemy holds the Thing that proves his
involvement, and blackmails him ruthlessly.
76. A courier mistakes the party for the wrong set of
offworlders, and wordlessly deposits a Thing with
them that implies something awful- med-frozen,
child-sized human organs, for example, or a private catalog of gengineered human slaves. The
courier’s boss shortly realizes the error, and this
Enemy tries to silence the PCs while preserving
the Place where his evil is enacted.
77. A slowboat system freighter is taken over by Enemy separatist terrorists at the same time as the
planet’s space defenses are taken offline by internal
terrorist attacks. The freighter is aimed straight at
the starport, and will crash into it in hours if not
stopped.
78. Alien artifacts on the planet’s surface start beaming
signals into the system’s asteroid belt. The signals
provoke a social Complication in panicked response, and an Enemy seeks to use the confusion
to take over. The actual effect of the signals might
be harmless, or might summon a long-lost alien AI
warship to scourge life from the world.
79. An alien ambassador Friend is targeted by xenophobe Enemy assassins. Relations are so fragile
that if the ambassador even realizes that humans
are making a serious effort to kill him, the result
may be war.
80. A new religion is being preached by a Friend on
this planet. Existing faiths are not amused, and
an Enemy among the hierarchy is provoking the
people to persecute the new believers, hoping for
things to get out of hand.
81. An Enemy was once the patron of a Friend until
the latter was betrayed. Now the Friend wants revenge, and they think they have the information
necessary to get past the Enemy’s defenses.
82. Vital life support or medical equipment has been
sabotaged by offworlders or zealots, and must be
repaired before time runs out. The only possible
source of parts is at a Place, and the saboteurs can
be expected to be working hard to get there and
destroy them, too.

190• Adventure Seeds
83. A Friend is importing offworld tech that threatens
to completely replace the offerings of an Enemy
businessman. The Enemy seeks to sabotage the
friend’s stock, and thus ’prove’ its inferiority.
84. An Exchange diplomat is negotiating for the opening of a branch of the interstellar bank on this
world. An Enemy among the local banks wants to
show the world as being ungovernably unstable,
so provokes Complications and riots around the
diplomat.
85. An Enemy is infuriated by the uppity presumption
of an ambitious Friend of a lower social caste, and
tries to pin a local Complication on the results of
his unnatural rejection of his proper place.
86. A Friend is working for an offworld corporation
to open a manufactory, and is ignoring local traditions that privilege certain social or ethnic groups,
giving jobs to the most qualified workers instead.
An angry Enemy seeks to sabotage the factory.
87. An offworld musician who was revered as little less
than a god on his homeworld requires bodyguards.
He immediately acquires Enemies on this world
with his riotous ways, and his guards must keep
him from getting arrested if they are to be paid.
88. Atmospheric disturbances, dust storms, or other
particulate clouds suddenly blow into town, leaving the settlement blind. An Enemy commits a
murder during the darkness, and attempts to frame
the players as convenient scapegoats.
89. An Enemy spikes the oxygen supply of an orbital station or unbreathable-atmosphere hab dome
with hallucinogens as cover for a theft. Most victims are merely confused and disoriented, but
some become violent in their delusions. By chance,
the party’s air supply was not contaminated.
90. By coincidence, one of the party members is wearing clothing indicative of membership in a violent
political group, and thus the party is treated in
friendly fashion by a local Enemy for no obvious
reason. The Enemy assumes that the party will go
along with some vicious crime without complaint,
and the group isn’t informed of what’s in the offing
until they’re in deep.
91. A local ruler wishes outworlders to advise him of
the quality of his execrable poetry- and is the sort
to react very poorly to anything less that evidently
sincere and fulsome praise. Failure to amuse the
ruler results in the party being dumped in a dangerous Place to “experience truly poetic solitude”.
92. A Friend among the locals is unreasonably convinced that offworlder tech can repair anything,
and has blithely promised a powerful local Enemy that the party can easily fix a damaged pretech
Thing. The Enemy has invested in many expensive spare parts, but the truly necessary pieces are
kept in a still-dangerous pretech installation in a
remote Place.

93. The party’s offworld comm gear picks up a chance
transmission from the local government and automatically descrambles the primitive encryption
key. The document is proof that an Enemy in government intends to commit an atrocity against a
local village with a group of “deniable” renegades
in order to steal a Thing kept in the village.
94. A Friend belongs to a persecuted faith, ethnicity,
or social class, and appeals for the PCs to help a
cell of rebels get offworld before the Enemy law
enforcement finds them.
95. A part on the party’s ship or the only other transport out has failed, and needs immediate replacement. The only available part is held by an Enemy,
who will only willingly relinquish it in exchange
for a Thing held by an innocent Friend who will
refuse to sell at any price.
96. Eugenics cultists are making gengineered slaves
out of genetic material gathered at a local brothel.
Some of the unnaturally tempting slaves are being
slipped among the prostitutes as bait to infatuate
powerful officials, while others are being sold under the table to less scrupulous elites.
97. Evidence has been unearthed at a Place that substantial portions of the planet are actually owned
by members of an oppressed and persecuted group.
The local courts have no intention of recognizing
the rights, but the codes with the ownership evidence would allow someone to bypass a number
of antique pretech defenses around the planetary
governor’s palace. A Friend wants the codes to pass
to his friends among the group’s rebels.
98. A crop smut threatens the planet’s agriculture,
promising large-scale famine. A Friend finds evidence that a secret government research station
in the system’s asteroid belt was conducting experiments in disease-resistant crop strains for the
planet before the Silence struck and cut off communication with the station. The existing government considers it a wild goose chase, but the party
might choose to help. The station has stasis-frozen
samples of the crop sufficient to avert the famine,
but it also has less pleasant relics….
99. A grasping Enemy in local government seizes the
party’s ship for some trifling offense. The Enemy
wants to end offworld trade, and is trying to scare
other traders away. The starship is held within a
military cordon, and the Enemy is confident that
by the time other elements of the government
countermand the order, the free traders will have
been spooked off.
100. A seemingly useless trinket purchased by a PC
turns out to be the security key to a lost pretech
facility. It was sold by accident by a bungling and
now-dead minion of a local Enemy, who is hot after the party to “reclaim” his property… preferably
after the party defeats whatever automatic defenses and bots the facility might still support.

An Example of Adventure Creation •191

An Example of Adventure Creation
The GM has just started a new campaign, and he needs
to brew up an initial adventure to pull the party together and get them accustomed to the sector he’s just
created. He knows what planet the PCs are going to
begin on and he knows he wants them to end up owning a battered free merchant starship by the end of the
session, but the rest is still up in the air.
He starts by deciding whether or not to use an adventure seed. While he sees a few that might work, he
decides instead to roll up this adventure from scratch.
The world he’s created is a planet known to its
natives as Delaine, with the world tags “Alien Ruins”
and “Xenophobes”. The Delainers have numerous unexplored alien ruins on their world, but fear them as
potential sources of catastrophe. They hate outsiders
because the offworlders are constantly prodding at the
ruins and trying to loot them, and care nothing for the
disasters they might unleash on the locals.
The GM knows that his first batch of PCs are very
unlikely to all be Delainers, so he decides that they were
all passengers on a smuggler ship that tried to land on
Delaine and loot one of the ruins. The Delainer defense
grid spotted the ship and knocked it down, however,
and the PCs were among the few survivors. Maybe the
PCs were initially part of the smuggler crew, or maybe they were just oblivious passengers. The GM will
let each player decide what their PC’s role was during
character creation.
The first step is to pick a Problem for the PCs to
get involved in. On the face of it, the obvious Problem
for the PCs is that they’re marooned on a hostile world
and need to get off before the natives find them and
either kill or imprison them.
The GM wants something a little more specific
than this, however. He rolls some dice on the Conflict
table, and comes up with “Ethnicity” for the Conflict,
with “Two groups that hate each other” and “Official
ethnic ghettos”. Given Delaine’s history, the GM decides that any non-native Delainers present when the
world shut down its contact with other planets were
separated out into remote ethnic reservations, far away
from the ruins. These “offworlders” have been here for
generations but are despised by the native Delainers.
With that established, the GM decides that the
PC’s ship was shot down near one of these reservations,
and the bitter offworlders are interested in helping people whom the Delainers hate. But who will the initial
Person the PCs contact be?
The dice paint the picture of an offworlder motivated to redeem themselves from a prior failure,
who wants to find proof of a rival NPC’s malfeasance,
who knows where significant wealth is to be found,
and wears a particularly odd style of dress. From this,
the GM creates “the Captain”, a former ruin smuggler
whose crew was gunned down while trying to loot an

alien ruin. Only he survived, and his guilt is intense.
He still wears a nautical captain’s hat, and is hiding out
among the offworlders. He knows where he’s hidden
his ship and can guide the PCs to it if they can make
the dangerous overland journey.
The GM isn’t so certain about the Captain’s want,
however. While something like that would make a
good sideline for a longer adventure, he wants this
initial adventuring session to be relatively short and
straightforward. He replaces the want with the Captain’s desire for the PCs to get him and his young offworlder wife off the planet, bringing them to just about
any place that isn’t on Delaine. He’s willing to give the
PCs his ship if they just help him get away.
Why hasn’t the Captain snuck off with his young
bride yet? To answer that question, the GM turns to
the Places section and rolls up a hazard. The result is
“Sentient”, which means that there’s an intelligent enemy between the Captain and the ship. The GM mulls
over the possibilities for a while, and decides the Captain wasn’t the only survivor. His first mate made it out
too, and blames the Captain. He’s gathered together a
small band of offworlder rebels and is seeking to loot
ruins and harm Delainers, because he can’t operate the
ship without the Captain’s security codes and he’s not
sufficiently talented to hack the locks himself.
At this point, the GM looks at the adventure and
identifies the bits he needs to flesh out. He needs to
detail the Captain, the first mate, the offworlder rebels,
and the Delainer security chief who will seek to apprehend the PCs if they’re not sufficiently stealthy. All of
these people will need combat stats. The Captain’s wife,
the offworlder reservation locals, and other bit NPCs
are unlikely to get into a fight, and don’t need stats.
The GM decides he doesn’t need a map for the
offworlder reservation settlement, but he does need
a map of the terrain between the settlement and the
hidden ship. He downloads a suitable terrain map from
the web for that. On the map, he plants a few Wilderness Ongoings from the Places table that the PCs may
or may not encounter depending on how they chart
their course.
The last detail to flesh out is the first mate’s rebel
camp, and how the PCs might get at the starship they’re
guarding. The GM decides that it’s not reasonable for
the first mate to have accumulated a vast number of
minions, but there are too many for the PCs to comfortably engage. The PCs will have to think of some
way to distract them, or possibly sic the Delainer security chief on them before they can get to the ship. It’s
not the GM’s job to hand them a solution, so they’ll
have to puzzle it out on their own.
With that done, the starting adventure is ready.
The GM might add some more details and fluff, but
what he has is a playable start to a campaign.

XENOBESTIARY
A band of interstellar adventurers can expect to encounter a wide range of creatures in the course of their
travels. Whether the hungry fauna of an uncharted
planet or the trigger-happy gunmen of an alien organ
smuggler, a GM needs to have the relevant statistics at
hand to manage probable hostilities.

Handling Potential Combat

Before picking foes from this chapter, however, a GM
should make sure that the enemies chosen and the
perils generated are appropriate for the situation. This
does not mean that the enemies have to be an “appropriate” combat challenge for the PC group, one that
they have a reasonable chance of defeating. It means
that they should be appropriate to the location and role
they fill in the setting.
If there’s a stretch of wilderness adjacent to a human community, a party-eating hellbeast should not
be lairing there without some notice by the locals. If
such an unstoppable horror does exist secretly in the
wilderness, the fact that it is hidden should be somehow
explained or meaningful. NPCs notice hazards next
door, and PCs who pay attention should hear about
that danger before they end up walking into its cave.
In the same vein, if the PCs run into a bunch of
street thugs, the hooligans should not be exhibiting
Spartan discipline and crack military expertise unless
the PCs have gone slumming on a planet of genetic
super-soldiers. The goons might actually not be much
of a combat threat at all, and dangerous only for the
potential grudges the PCs could earn in executing them.
Lastly, don’t add combat encounters that are unavoidable. There are very few realistic situations where
the only possible result is a gun battle. A group of trigger-happy mercs might happen to be sitting directly on
top of the party’s objective, but if there’s no way to lure
them away or sneak past them– or worse, if you’re not
prepared to allow the PCs to try to lure them away or
sneak past them– then the players will learn not to try
to solve problems with anything but a hot gun barrel.
Combat in Stars Without Number is dangerous.
Every squeeze of a trigger risks killing a novice adventurer, and even a veteran of countless heroic deeds
can get mowed down in a hurry by a half-dozen goons
with mag rifles. If your adventures funnel the PCs into
near-unavoidable firefights or saber-toothed alien
monsters, the PCs are going to suffer casualties. A certain degree of death can add spice and excitement to a
game and help make player choices feel more meaningful, but inevitable gory disembowelment in the third
inescapable pirate brawl of the day is just tedious.

The Reaction Roll

One of the GM’s most important tools for managing
encounters with NPCs is the reaction roll. Whenever
the PCs first meet with a creature or NPC, the GM
should roll 2d6 and consult the following table.
2d6

Reaction Result

2

Hostile, reacting as negatively as is plausible

3-5

Negative, unfriendly and unhelpful

6-8

Neutral, reacting predictably or warily

9-11

Positive, potentially cooperative with PCs

12

Friendly, helpful as is plausible to be

The result should be taken in context. If the PCs
just happen to run into a pack of hab-complex gangers, a positive result might simply mean the gangers
think it’s a bad idea to interfere with the PCs. That
same result when meeting a bored starport bureaucrat
might mean she’s feeling magnanimous, and is willing
to help the PCs accomplish their purpose. In general,
low results make the situation more hostile than the
predictable baseline, while high results make the NPC
more friendly or cooperative than they might normally
be under the circumstances.
Reaction rolls are important because they help a
GM adjudicate a situation in a potentially surprising or
interesting way. If the PCs are crossing a radioactive
badland crawling with violent scavenger tribes, the
GM might just reflexively assume that every scavenger
band they encounter is immediately going to reach for
their scrap-guns. A reaction roll is a cue for the GM
to pause and think, and a friendly result can open up a
situation with far more potential novelty than the sixth
consecutive gun battle. Conversely, even if everything
seems to suggest an NPC should be helpful and friendly
toward the PCs, a negative result can get the GM thinking about potential reasons why the NPC is so hostile
towards supposedly allied PCs.
An NPC or a group’s initial reaction is not the last
word, of course. A silver-tongued PC might be able to
talk them out of hostility or induce them to do the party
a favor, and more pragmatic offers of money, favors,
or incipient violence might also sway their attitudes.
Such manipulation happens after the initial attitude is
determined, however, and what exactly the PCs offer
or threaten will usually depend on how the NPC is initially reacting to them.

194• Humanity

Humanity
Humans are likely to form the great majority of the
NPCs that the heroes encounter, whether as patrons,
companions, or the targets of their guns. In many cases
a GM won’t need to bother with combat statistics for an
NPC. They might be so unmartial that they can present
no serious threat to a party of hardened freebooters, or
so distant that there’s no real chance that they’ll become
engaged in combat. In others, however, it’s necessary to
decide how much a particular NPC is worth in a fight.
The example human opponents here assume
normal baseline humanity. Those who have received
extensive cyberware, gengineering, psychic augmentation, or other exotic treatments may have abilities far
in excess of their normal brethren, including unique
powers and special abilities.

Degrees of Danger

Most human NPCs on advanced, civilized planets are
of almost no use in combat. By societal training and
personal inclination, they are almost incapable of responding to lethal threats with a quick, decisive reaction. Citizens of less peaceful societies, where violence
is a commonplace, will have more useful reactions
to such hostilities. Men and women who have been
hardened to combat by experience or training will also
respond more effectively.
The combat statistics provided here cover the usual range of human martial talent. At the bottom are
those soft citizens of peaceful worlds and at the top
are those engines of mortal ruin who are the most dangerous men and women in the sector. Even more heroic appetites for slaughter can be found in those who
have been altered by genetic engineering or advanced
technical modifications, but such paragons of pain are
special cases to be judged by the GM accordingly.
When assigning combat statistics to NPC, it’s important not to be influenced by the personal prowess of
the PCs. If country estate is protected by ordinary security guards, then the guards should be ordinary security
guards, whether or not the party could reasonably hope
to defeat a dozen such protectors in open combat. The
universe does not scale to the PCs. If a party of untested novices finds themselves facing a squad of elite
killers, they should run. If those famously lethal killers
encounter the PCs six levels later, their fame might get
abbreviated in a hurry by the PCs’ grim new expertise.
This even-handedness is important in creating a
plausible, functional world for the players to operate in.
If they know that challenges will be scaled up or down
to give them a “fair fight” then it hardly matters what
challenges they choose to face. Planning to carefully
avoid excess dangers and betting on overcoming more
reasonable threats makes their choices meaningful in
your game world, and encourages the players to engage
carefully with the setting.

Using the Table

The table provided in this section gives you benchmarks for some basic NPC types and then a selection
of specific examples. When you’re creating your own
NPCs, you can use the benchmarks to get an idea of
where they should be, and the specific examples can be
pulled during play when you’re in need of quick opponents to stock your adventures.
The table provides simplified combat statistics.
NPCs don’t normally have foci, specific skill levels,
attribute scores, or any of the other details that add
complexity to PCs. Nor do they have classes or class
abilities. Instead, simpler totals and summaries are used
to account for these other factors. You can give NPCs
class powers and foci if you wish, or even create an
NPC as if they were a full-fledged PC, but that kind
of detail and work is more than most NPCs are worth.
HD is the NPC’s hit dice. The overwhelming majority of NPCs have only one hit die. Only men and
women with a history of surviving violence and dealing with mortal peril should have more than one hit
die. Just because an NPC is “important” doesn’t mean
they have more hit dice. The CEO of an interstellar
megacorp probably has one hit die, as does the president of the planetary government. Conversely, the
grizzled warrior-king of a lostworlder monarchy or a
poison-wary bishop of a church where promotion is
through mortality might have half a dozen hit dice. The
most danger-hardened legends of a sector should have
about ten hit dice, or more if they’ve been somehow
altered by gengineering or advanced technology. An
NPC’s hit points are rolled at 1d8 for each hit die.
AC is the NPC’s usual Armor Class. This will vary
with the armor they’re wearing, and some NPCs might
have an included +1 or +2 bonus if they’re especially
dexterous, but the listed score reflects the armor they
usually have on. By default, this is street armor that
is not obvious to casual inspection. Some entries are
marked “primitive”, meaning that their armor is ignored by advanced weapons, while others are marked
“combat”, meaning that they wear very obviously protective armor. Such NPCs might need to wear less obvious gear in some social situations. A few of them are
marked “powered”, meaning that the NPC normally
has access to some kind of advanced power armor that
renders them immune to primitive weapons. When
creating your own NPCs, give them the armor that is
appropriate to their role and situation.
Atk is the NPC’s attack bonus. For the sake of simplicity, this includes any attribute modifiers, skill bonus,
or other extra lethality that the NPC might have earned.
For most NPCs, their attack bonus is equal to their hit
dice. Martial NPCs might have an additional bonus on
top of that, or even attack twice with each Main Action.

Dmg is the damage the NPC inflicts in combat. For
human combatants, this depends on the weapon they’re
using, with most ordinary men and women carrying
no real weapon. Very capable warriors might do additional damage on top of the weapon’s roll, from +1
to +4 points.
Move is the distance the NPC travels when they
take a Move action in combat. For humans, this is ten
meters, though gengineered or other boosted subjects
might be able to move faster than this.
ML is the NPC’s Morale score, their likelihood of
retreating when in danger. When an NPC faces unusual peril, they need to make a Morale check on 2d6.
If they roll equal or less than their Morale score, they
withstand the danger and continue fighting. If they roll
more than their Morale, they break. Poorly-trained
combatants will simply run for their lives or beg for
mercy, while more hardened ones will make a fighting
withdrawal to a place of safety. PCs never need to make
Morale checks.
Most groups will need to make a Morale check
the first time one of their members is killed or disabled,
and the first time it looks like they’re losing the fight. If
they succeed in both checks, they’ll continue fighting as
long as it doesn’t seem hopeless. NPCs with no martial
aptitude at all must also make a Morale check when
lethal combat begins; on a failure, they’re too shocked,
frightened, or disbelieving to do anything useful, and
will stand frozen, run in terror, or try to ignore what’s
obviously happening around them.

Skills summarizes the NPC’s general aptitude at
skill checks related to their profession or role. When
the NPC needs to make a skill check or compete in an
opposed skill check, they may add this skill bonus to
their roll if the test relates to role. If the activity has
nothing especially to do with what the NPC would be
good at, they cannot add this bonus, and just roll the
skill check unmodified. Most NPCs will have this at
+1, while skilled professionals will have it at +2, and
exceptionally gifted and expert NPCs will have it at +3
or +4. Sector-wide legends will have it at +5.
Saves are the single saving throw score that all
NPCs use whenever they need to make a saving throw.
Whether Mental Physical, or Evasion, the NPC rolls
against this single target. Most NPCs have a save score
of 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down.

Psychics and Special Traits
When building NPCs with psychic powers or other special abilities, it’s usually not worth the effort
of rolling them up like PCs. Just assign them a few
abilities you think will matter during the game and
give them a third of their hit dice in maximum
Effort, rounded up.
In the same vein, gengineered humans or
rare virtuosos might have abilities akin to Foci or
unique powers. Just assign them as fits the situation, and don’t worry about making them like PCs.

196• Robots and VIs

Robots and VIs
The prevalence of robots varies between sectors. Some
positively teem with sentient VIs programmed for various purposes, while others have hardly any robotics at
all beyond industrial automation. The creation of particularly sophisticated bots, especially sentient-seeming
VIs, is critically influenced by the local metadimensional energy environment. With an unfriendly higher-order energy shadow, the intricate quantum flux of VI
“brains” cannot function properly. True AIs are immune
to such vagaries, but True AIs are almost impossible
to create in bulk, even for the lost industries of the
Terran Mandate.

Expert Systems and VIs

In the vast majority of sectors, robots are operated
by expert systems programmed to carry out a specific
kind of work. These expert systems may feign human
intelligence, but they are non-sentient and incapable
of dealing with environments and situations outside
their normal operational scope. The more sophisticated and expensive the expert system, the more flexible
it is about handling events within its purview.
In some sectors, however, the local environment
is suitable for the creation of extremely sophisticated
expert systems bolstered by quantum neural nets. It is
a constant point of debate over whether the resultant
“Virtual Intelligences” are truly self-aware or simply
give a perfect impression of such. Some sectors hold
the former, and grant VI full human rights, forbidding
their makers from implanting behavioral imperatives.
Most sectors believe the latter, using VIs as a labor
force programmed to deeply enjoy their utilitarian
function. VIs in such sectors can be bought, sold, and
mistreated much as any other piece of property.
While VIs have or can mimic human-level intelligence, they can also be programmed with behavioral
imperatives or curbs, giving them a deep urge to perform a certain kind of work or an unbreakable inability
to carry out certain kinds of acts. Most service VIs are
programmed with imperatives to love their work and
be thoroughly happy in carrying it out, as well as with
curbs against harming human beings or allowing themselves to be damaged. These impulses are overwhelming, but not especially nuanced; the more specific and
complex the programmed psychological limit, the more
prone it is to failure or misguidance.
VIs are not True AIs. They do not have a quantum
identity core and they are inexorably tied into the specific hardware and chassis they were created to operate.
While mods and adjustments can be made to this “birth
body”, the VI cannot be transplanted into a new chassis,
nor can they survive the destruction of their body.
VIs are much more difficult to produce than
non-sentient expert systems. The quantum growth
process is much more reliable and tractable than that

used to create a True AI, but it still fails annoyingly
often. As a consequence, even sectors where the environment allows the creation of VIs often prefer to
use simple, cheap, reliably-replicable “dumb” expert
systems for mundane tasks.

Expert System Bots

The robots listed in the adjacent table are standard-issue expert system bots, each one equipped with a level
1 expert system. Each expert system is programmed to
handle a particular role: security, tour guidance, industrial labor, household cleaning, personal companionship, child care, or some other general field. The most
basic programming and cognitive hardware counts as
a “level 1” system. More sophisticated work allows for
level 2 programming, up to level 4 as the maximum for
most TL4 sectors.
Each level of expert system beyond the first comes
with upgrades to the robot’s durability, danger management, and exception handling skills. They also add to
the robot’s base cost; a level 2 expert system doubles a
robot’s base cost, for example. The table below gives
the various expert system levels, the hit die and saving
throw bonus granted by each, the attack bonus a given
level adds, and the skill check modifier to be applied to
checks related to the bot’s intended function.

Whenever the bot is put in a position not covered by its programming, it needs to make a confusion
check. The GM rolls 2d6, adding its skill bonus, against
a difficulty based on the strangeness of the situation.
A situation partly within its usual compass might be
difficulty 7, while a completely uncovered event would
be difficulty 9, and a situation that is both completely
uncovered and clearly dangerous would be 11. On a
success, the expert system does something reasonable
and in line with its function. On a failure, the expert
system does what it’s normally meant to do in an inappropriate way or direction.
Damaged bots can be repaired by someone with at
least Fix-0 skill and a postech toolkit. One unit of spare
parts and fifteen minutes of work can repair a number
of lost hit points equal to the bot’s expert system level.
Expert system bots reduced to zero hit points are destroyed and cannot be salvaged.
Expert system bots do have “morale” of a kind;
when destruction seems imminent, most are programmed to retreat. This can be overridden by owners.

In sectors where VIs can still be manufactured, the
price is equivalent to ten times the cost of an equivalent expert system bot. Thus, a stock companion bot
upgraded with VI programming would cost 25,000
credits. To give a top-of-the-line heavy warbot with
a level 4 expert system VI wiring would leave the bot
costing a tremendous four million credits.
VI wiring does not integrate well with conventional expert system programming. The same static
procedures and protocols that can make a level 4 expert system so good at its specific task are difficult for
a human-like VI intellect to process, and it requires
intensive and expensive cognitive reinforcement to
allow the VI to take advantage of these resources. As a
consequence, it is very rare for VIs to be implanted in
high-end expert system bots.
Most VIs do not develop additional skills or competencies, nor do they exhibit personal growth or
changes in personality. They are the way they have
been programmed, even if inhibitor curbs and behavioral imperatives are absent.
Some VIs, however, are different. For whatever
inexplicable reason, these VIs are capable of learning
and growing as human beings are. They lack the potential for godlike intelligence possessed by True AIs
and they cannot make effective use of supplementary
cognitive resources as True AIs can, but over time and
with experience, these VIs can become as skilled and
capable as any human.
Such “clever” VIs are an annoyance in sectors
where VI bots are common. Buyers don’t want their
receptionist bots to suddenly decide they’d rather be
poets, and while behavioral imperatives and inhibitor
curbs still have an effect on clever VIs, some of these
bots can “out-think” their limits and sidestep these
blocks. Some worlds allow clever VIs to exist as free
citizens, while others consider them public nuisances
to be scrapped if they wander off from their owners.
VI bots are more durable than their ordinary cousins. If reduced to zero hit points by trauma less than a
hit with a Heavy weapon or similar complete ruin, they
can be repaired with 24 hours of work by one tech with
Fix-0. Jury-rigging a downed VI back into operation is
much faster, allowing them to “heal” with spare parts
as if they were an ordinary bot. If reduced to zero HP
again before a 24-hour overhaul, however, they perish.

While a wide range of bots are available on the market
in most sectors, the selection given here cover most of
the robots likely to be encountered by PCs. Most civilian bots are programmed to avoid harming humans,
but such programming can be overridden by sufficiently determined owners.
Janitor bots are ubiquitous, cheap and reliable
droids that can clean up detritus and keep an office,
street, or private home tidy. Their small size and limited array of tools make them useless in a fight save as
targets or convenient explosives carriers.
Civilian security bots are sometimes found guarding locations. They’re not smart enough to handle
complex human interactions, but their tireless determination is convenient when guarding a place that few
humans are expected to enter. Most models use a stunning touch that non-lethally disables targets, while less
gentle bots are equipped with guns or melee weapons.
Repair bots and industrial work bots are found at
work sites and in starships or other complex technical
edifices. Expert system repair bots are extremely efficient about dealing with standard failures and damage,
but they can “panic” when faced with crises beyond
their usual operating parameters. Industrial work bots
are slow, tough, heavy machines most often used for
lifting and manipulating heavy objects in need of laser
welding or other shaping.
Companion bots range from nannybots and petbots
to specially-designed “companions” for other purposes.
The latter are strictly regulated on many worlds, either
to encourage reproduction, to quash their use for reprehensible urges, or out of perceived fears of societal
decay and decadence.
Soldier bots are designed on humanoid lines so as
to easily use standard human vehicles and equipment.
The chaotic and confusing nature of warfare leaves
most soldier bots of somewhat limited utility without
a human bot wrangler to direct them, but when a wave
attack is needed, a simple self-preservation toggle can
be flipped off and the iron horde can be aimed at a foe.
Heavy warbots are ogreish engines of war with integral plasma guns and the ability to attack twice with
each Main Action. In addition, most are capable of
mounting a Heavy weapon which may be fired in lieu
of the plasma guns. They’re most often used as mobile
heavy weapons platforms for squads in the field.

198• Robots and VIs

Robots In Your Campaign

A GM is not obligated to include VIs or ubiquitous robotics in her campaign. Adding these elements can have
a significant effect on a setting, and sometimes they
can prove to be a distraction from the sort of play that
the group wants to have. A GM is always well within
her rights to simply decide that the sector lacks the
necessary metadimensional environment for VI production and is short on many of the critical minerals
for producing expert system bots. Outside of industrial
assembly lines and mindless extraction work, labor is
performed by humans.
Sometimes, however, a GM will want to include
VIs in her sector, either because she’s emulating a genre
where intelligent robots are a commonplace, or because
a particular player wants to play a PC VI, or because
she simply likes them.
If a GM does decide to add VIs to her setting, she’ll
need to decide how common they are and how most
of the worlds in the sector treat them. The simplest
way to do this is to gently gloss over the economic and
social impact of VIs. The world operates much as it
does today, with humans doing most of the work and
VIs serving only occasional functions as showpieces
of the wealthy or off-stage laborers in industry. They
are programmed to love their work, they’re “happy” in
a robotic sense, and the various worlds of the sector
give little consideration to wider issues of VI rights or
the morality of programmed VI behavioral imperatives.

Other GMs will want to increase the impact of VIs
on particular worlds. Perhaps some of them have largely replaced their low-skilled members with VI laborers,
and the replaced humans are either frustrated and angry or kept pacified by robotic dole payments. Other
worlds might dispute the lack of rights that most VIs
have, insisting that a VI ought not to be programmed
with behavioral imperatives at “birth”, but be allowed
to choose its own functionality. Of course, it might be
that almost no one would bother to build them in that
case, but such crusaders might believe it better that a
VI never be “born” than that it be created in servitude.
In brief, the GM can pick some aspect of VI existence
and use the conflicts inherent in it to spice up the sector.
Expert system bots are less disruptive to a campaign because they come with less moral baggage that
a society has to deal with. It’s easy for a GM to simply
decide that most expert system bots are only smart
enough for simple industrial tasks or menial labor, and
that the impact they have on the local economy doesn’t
necessarily force it into some strange futuristic pattern.
There are still poor janitors, grouchy middle-aged security guards, and cynical street-corner prostitutes in
an age of robotic labor.
Some PC groups will be very keen to buy robots
of their own, the better to help in their adventures. So
long as you keep an expert system’s limitations in mind,
this shouldn’t be disruptive, and it would make an excellent sink for a party’s excess money.

VI Player Characters •199

VI Player Characters
In campaigns where the GM allows it, a player can
choose to make a VI as a player character. They do this
by spending their free focus pick on one of the origins
listed below. These origin foci have only one level, and
normally can only be taken during character creation.
In exceptional cases, a human PC transformed into a
full-conversion cyborg might be allowed to take it later.

Special VI Rules

All VI PCs have the same attributes, hit points, abilities,
and character classes as humans do, but normal VIs
cannot be Psychics nor take the Partial Psychic class
option for Adventurers. They are created the same
way as any other human PC and start out at first level.
While they may have been built to be a particular type
of bot, they use their own statistics, and not those for
their type on page 197. VIs that are not wearing armor
normally have Armor Class 10, just as humans do.
VIs need neither sleep, eat, nor drink, requiring
one Type B cell per week of operation away from readily-available current. They are immune to vacuum but
suffer degradation from radiation as humans do. They
cannot be poisoned or diseased by normal forms of
toxin. They can be reprogrammed, altering or erasing
their personality and behavioral limits, but such mental remodeling takes at least an undisturbed month to
execute by someone with at least Program-1 skill. Most
VIs will fight to their destruction to avoid such a fate.
VIs can be healed with spare parts and the work of
someone with Fix-0 skill. VIs can always repair themselves, even without the requisite skill. Each unit of
spare parts heals lost hit points equal to the VI’s character level and takes fifteen minutes to apply. VIs cannot
normally be affected by biopsionic healing effects.
VIs reduced to zero hit points but not entirely
smashed are incapacitated and Badly Damaged. Removing this quality requires 24 hours of work by a
technician and at least one unit of spare parts, after
which damage can be repaired as normal. As a field
expedient, a tech can jury-rig a Badly Damaged VI in
the field, healing it with spare parts at the normal rate
and speed. If such a bot is reduced to zero hit points
again while Badly Damaged, however, it must make a
Physical save or be permanently destroyed.
VIs are intimately connected to their specific hardware, and cannot be transplanted into new forms. Cosmetic alterations can be made, however, and equipment
can be grafted into the VI’s chassis. Such built-in equipment costs twice as much as a stand-alone component
and takes a week to properly integrate into the VI’s
system. A VI can have a total number of encumbrance
points worth of additional gear grafted onto it equal to
half its Constitution score, rounded down. Such gear
may require its own separate power source or ammunition supply. VIs cannot make use of cyberware.

Android

You were built as an android, a robot indistinguishable from a human without a medical-grade inspection.
Most androids are “companion” bots, though other VIs
with roles that involve significant human interaction
may also be built as androids. Minor scuffs and cuts
don’t reveal your robotic nature, but if reduced to zero
hit points, your unnatural innards are obvious.
Level 1: Gain a bonus skill related to your intended function. You have all the usual traits and abilities of
a VI robot.

VI Worker Bot

You were built for industrial or technical labor, where
a human face was an unnecessary luxury. Most such
VI bots are humanoid, if only to more conveniently
manipulate human-scale devices, but their inhuman
nature is obvious.
Level 1: Gain a bonus skill related to your intended
function. Choose an attribute associated with your
work and gain a +1 bonus to its modifier, up to a
maximum of +2. You have all the usual traits and
abilities of a VI robot.

VI Vehicle Bot

Some VIs were instantiated in actual vehicles rather
than conventional humanoid bodies. Most were purely
synthetic in origins, but some sectors retain the techniques for brain transplants into non-human bodies.
Some polities have been known to conduct full-body
cyberneticization of soldiers into tanks, warships, attack helicopters, and other military vehicles. As a vehicle, you are usually equipped with manipulator arms
that can be used on adjacent objects. You may operate the individual elements of your vehicle as if they
were your own limbs, attacking once per round with a
mounted weapon of your choice.
Level 1: Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. Pick a vehicle acceptable to the GM, usually a drone, hoverbike
or gravcar. You become that vehicle. You retain
your usual attributes but gain the vehicle’s Armor
score. You are Armor Class 10, modified by your
Dexterity score. A tech can improve your Armor
Class by aftermarket modifications, adding up to
three times their Fix skill to your Armor Class at
a cost of 1,000 credits per point of improvement.
You use the vehicle’s hit points until your
own normally-rolled hit point score exceeds that
number. Many VI vehicles purchase a drone or
humanoid robot body to carry on board and employ for remote operation in areas unsuitable for
a vehicle; you can pilot a single surrogate body in
lieu of your own Main Action, provided there’s no
ECM to jam the control transmissions.

200• Beasts

Beasts
Most alien beasts are simply flavor for a world, odd
creatures to decorate the background and provide some
light interest for the players. Sometimes, however, a
GM needs a genuinely dangerous beast, either to occupy some perilous wilderness or to threaten the PCs
and their allies.
When creating a beast, work from your needs.
Build the creature with the statistics and role that you
need for your adventure, and then decorate those basic
statistics with the creature’s appearance, special hazards,
and behavior.

Creating Beasts

To build an alien beast, it’s easiest to start with some
Terran referent. A completely alien and exotic creature
with no relation to any earthly life form tends to be
very difficult to explain to players and it can be awkward for the GM to guess its normal behavior.
The tables on the opposite page provide some basic suggestions for styling the essential animal features
of the beast. Start with the “Basic Animal Features” to
get the creature’s general theme, and then move on to
identify its body plan. You might then add on some
novelty to its limbs or skin, decide the main weapon it
uses to hunt prey or defend itself, and choose a general
size for the animal.
The basic animal features serve only as a starting
point for your creativity. The creature might have a
mammalian general plan, but you could then decide
that its “fur” is a stiff, glassy mineral exudate that slashes
anything that bites or strikes it. It can be helpful to stick
to one basic animal type for a given alien world, with all
the creatures the PCs encounter sharing similar broad
features or common traits.
While a fully-developed ecosphere might include
countless different evolutionary strategies, sticking to
just one or two in play helps characterize a world and
give a sense of consistency to its fauna. If all the dangerous creatures of Scutum have thick moss-colored
armor plating, then the PCs will be able to guess that a
strange creature with thick moss-colored armor plating
is probably an import from Scutum.

Swarms

Sometimes a beast is only meaningfully dangerous in
vast packs, like a swarm of ants or a squealing tide of
ravenous rats. Other times beasts are found most often
in huge herds rather than as lone individuals.
To create such a swarm, take the basic animal type
and quadruple its hit dice. For tiny creatures that have
only 1 hit point, give the swarm 4 hit dice. The swarm
gets its usual attack against anyone in contact with it,
but on a miss, it still does the minimum possible damage to the target unless the victim is immune to its
attacks. Thus, a rat swarm that has a +1 attack bonus
and does 1d2 damage on a hit would roll that attack
against every PC caught in the swarm. On a hit, they
would do 1d2 damage, and a miss would still do 1 point.
Any attack against the swarm automatically hits,
assuming the weapon is useful. Firing a pistol into a
creeping carpet of ants is singularly useless, but waving
a flaming torch in front of rats or throwing a grenade
into the swarm might help dispatch the pack.

Beast Behavior

Many alien creatures will have no inherited aversion
to humans, and will not fear them. Predators will hunt
them if they look like food and prey will ignore them
if they don’t look like predators.
In combat, predators will only fight to the death if
maddened or cornered. Sane predators cannot afford to
get hurt while hunting. In addition to the usual times
for Morale checks, beasts must make an additional
check the first time their “prey” harms the predator.

Importing Creatures

Aside from the beasts you can create with these charts,
an endless supply of fantasy monsters and exotic creatures await lifting from other old-school games. Almost
any of the “monsters” found in traditional old-school
role-playing games can be imported almost unchanged
into Stars Without Number, requiring little more than
an attack bonus and Armor Class conversion. Reskin
them to fit your needs, and voila; you have your beast.

202• Aliens

Aliens
Exotic alien races are a staple of science fiction, and
most GMs running Stars Without Number are going
to want a few types of sapients to round out a sector.
Some GMs might prefer to run a strictly human game,
leaving humanity alone in this particular corner of the
cosmos, but other GMs will want to have the details
of a few alien races in hand, if only to help envision
the kind of artifacts and ruins that they might have left
behind. This section will discuss the role of aliens in a
game and a process for creating your own alien races.

The Use of Aliens in the Game

When adding an alien race to your sector, it’s necessary to keep in mind the ultimate purpose you have for
including them. A given species might be fascinating
to you, but if they don’t actually help to accomplish
something for your game it’s likely that the players will
simply gloss over their existence. By having a concrete
purpose in mind for a race you can ensure that the
players have a useful reason to interact with them.
Aliens are useful as antagonists. The classic “bugeyed monster” trope has survived for a reason; unthinkingly hostile and uncommunicative beings make great
fodder for brute physical struggle. Making these monsters part of a sapient, tool-using species allows them to
scale upward in threat the way no beast can, and continue to imperil even an experienced, well-equipped
band of adventurers.
Antagonism can take more forms than simple
combativeness. Aliens can want things, and want them
for reasons that would make no sense at all to a human.
Biological imperatives, exotic religions, alien philosophies, and customs born on completely un-Earth-like
worlds can all justify goals and purposes that would be
entirely irrational for a human being. Humans might
find themselves at cross purposes with these aliens
without ever fully understanding why the beings are
pursuing a given goal.
From a GM’s perspective, this is a wonderful trait
for building adventures. If you need aliens to pursue
some goal, however bizarre, you can simply add a trait
to them that makes that goal important. For example,
if you need aliens to be obsessed with wiping out the
humans on a given planet, you can simply decide that
the planet is their ancestral homeworld, to which they
must return every thousand years in order to perform a
great spawning rite. The presence of the humans there
defiles the world, and the aliens grow increasingly frantic as the time for the rite approaches.
Aliens also make excellent patrons for many of the
same reasons that they make good antagonists. You can
give them a good reason to want almost anything, and
players are unlikely to balk at it as unlikely or implausible. If you need to give the players a reason to go
somewhere, do something, or find something, you can

use aliens to drive the process. The matter might be
so important to the aliens that they find themselves
willing to employ human agents to accomplish their
ends, or it may be that only humans have the numbers
and strength to help them.
Aliens are occasions for exploration and discovery. While this may not have the immediate adventure
utility of an antagonist or a patron, one of the things
about sandbox gaming that appeals to many players
is the opportunity to go out and discover new things.
The universe is full of bizarre and exotic beings, and
there can be a lot of enjoyment in learning about their
cultures and traits. Most players aren’t interested in a
full-dress anthropological study of an alien race, but
there is an excitement in visiting uncharted worlds and
meeting strange and wondrous beings.
In some cases, this exploration doesn’t even need
live aliens. The universe is laden with numerous ancient alien ruins, and players can get a good conception
of a long-lost race simply from examining what they’ve
left behind. A GM with a firm grasp on a species’ psychology and physiology has much of what he needs to
create their abandoned cities and outposts and to stock
them with art, artifacts, and remnants for the enticement of exploring PCs.
Humanoid species make the most widely useful
aliens, and most of the species you create should probably be of that variety. Aliens that are too hard to understand tend to be more animate plot devices, operating
by utterly incomprehensible rules and motivations.
Human-like races allow more scope for diplomacy and
response to an alien culture, because their societies are
fundamentally comprehensible by humans.

The Like and the Others

Most alien races in the universe of Stars Without Number can be divided up into two different classes – the
Like and the Others. The Like are those species with intellects and societies that are at least somewhat comprehensible to humankind. They may have exotic biologies
and strange customs, but humans can understand their
motivations and deal with them within a more-or-less
comprehensible framework.
The Others are those species that are simply too
alien for human communication. Entities of sentient
lithic structures, congeries of crystal, even intelligent
waveform interactions created by the interplay of energies through alien rock formations… the Others are
simply too different for humans to understand. Their
goals are incomprehensible, their technology is often
hard to even recognize, let alone use, and it’s possible
that they don’t even realize that humanity is a sentient
species. The Others are generally avoided if at all possible, though at times “wars” break out when an Other
species vents anger on humanity for reasons unknown.

Aliens •203
Other races are rare, but some xenologists have
suggested that they may be much more common than
humanity imagines. Places that would never support
Like life might be teeming with the bizarre offspring
of Other organisms, unnoticed because human scouts
haven’t bothered to look in such unpromising places.
Many Other species might not even be recognized as
life by humanity.

Alien Biology

As a rule of thumb, it’s easiest to make Like aliens some
flavor of humanoid. They may have a few extra limbs
or somewhat different body geometry, but humanoid
aliens tend to be easier to build and run than those
with drastically different body types. There’s less need
to adjust human assumptions about architecture, technology, and clothing than there would be for a species
of six-legged centauroid mothmen. Of course, if you
enjoy the prospect of working out the ramifications of
having four gripping hands and organic wheels, you
shouldn’t feel shackled to the humanoid shape.
Aliens of the Other type can come in any shape or
size, largely because they aren’t intended to be comprehensible. Their technology and architecture doesn’t
need to have any link with human conceptions of such;
some Others may not even use technology as humans
understand it, but instead manipulate their environment with inborn abilities or subtype-creatures of their
own species. Most Other species function as plot devices in a game, and it’s not necessary to put the same
effort into detailing their “biology” if the species aren’t
intended to make human sense in the first place.
Humanlike aliens are just that; extremely close
to humans in outward appearance. They might have
unusual skin or hair coloration, different hair growth
distributions, an odd number of fingers, cranial ridges,
a novel skin texture, variant ear shapes, or different
average body builds or sizes, but they largely appear
like humans. Xenobiologists postulate that the human
shape is simply a very successful evolutionary route on
Earth-like planets, and other worlds with similar conditions are likely to produce similar sapients. Crank scientists tend to favor theories of pan-galactic Creators
that spread humanlike shapes throughout space; these
theories conspicuously fail to take into account the dramatically different DNA and internal organ makeup of
many humanlike aliens.
In general, it’s easiest to pick a particular real-world
type of organism as a basic template for an alien race.
The reality of their biology might be totally different,
but using a terrestrial animal as a basic pattern can help
you fill in details of structure and appearance that can
otherwise be difficult to extemporize.
Avian aliens favor birdlike features. Feathered
tails, wings, beaks, drastic coloring differences between
males and females, skin either partially or fully covered
in feathers, hollow bones, and clawed feet and hands
are all traits that might be present in an avian-flavored

alien. Such avians might have remarkably good vision
or show unusual talent as pilots thanks to an evolutionary predilection for thinking in three dimensions.
Reptilian aliens can range from the classic “lizard man” look to a more subtle combination of
pebble-scaled skin, membrane frills, broad bodies,
cold-bloodedness, nictitating membranes, an exceptional sense of smell, thick claws, powerful builds,
sharp teeth, and fine scales. Bodies may be broad and
thick like that of a lizard, or perhaps sinuous like that
of a snake. Reptilian aliens might be found especially
on damp, watery worlds, and might be outright amphibious over all or part of their life spans.
Insectile aliens are usually possessed of chitinous
“skin” and one or more pairs of compound eyes. Membranous wings aren’t unknown, but are probably vestigial and useless on all but the smallest or lightest aliens.
Insectile aliens might have sucking mouthparts if their
primary food source is plant sap- or blood- or might
use chewing mandibles instead for a more solid diet.
Insectile aliens that function as a hive collective are
something of a classic trope, but there’s no reason that
a species can’t instead take after more solitary hunting
insects such as beetles or spiders.
Mammalian aliens might have very human-like
appearances, or they might have fur, muzzles, claws, or
quadrupedal modes of locomotion. Mammalian aliens
are easy to conceptualize and describe, but if you want
to play up the alienness of them, you’ll likely need to
make sure they have some dramatic social or cultural
difference, or some unique element of physiognomy.
Exotic aliens are built out of parts and materials
that aren’t normally found in Terran life forms. A humanoid might be composed out of a kind of organic plastic that makes up much of their home planet’s
biochemistry, or be composed of an intricate array of
interlocking crystals and woody organic elements. You
should pick one or more materials that aren’t normally
part of an animal’s body and have them play a major
role in the alien’s biology. As a consequence, this kind
of alien is probably highly dependent upon their home
world for food and other biological necessities. If not,
they likely spend a lot of effort synthesizing vital materials out of local supplies.
Hybrid aliens combine aspects of two or more of
the types described here, and you can mix and match
their components to create some blend that suits your
purposes. Such hybrids might exist in multiple environments, or be in a transitional evolutionary state.

204• Aliens

Alien Psychology and Lenses

There are many different ways to fabricate a useful and
interesting alien race, ranging from careful development based on unique biologies or environments to
more abstract methods of defining interesting traits.
The method this section offers is intended to provide
a GM with a few tools for producing alien races that
feel sufficiently strange in play without leaving the GM
groping to figure out how a given alien would react to
a situation.
The first step is to understand that a Like alien race
is fundamentally human. They may be shaped differently, they may dwell in a radically different environment, but they think, feel, and desire largely as humans
do. Human vices and virtues almost certainly exist in
their society and they are susceptible to the same sort
of temptations and provocations that move humans. If
you want to know what an alien is like, the first thing
to do is to think of what a human is like.
The difference for aliens, however, is that they are
very strongly influenced by one or two emotional or
social traits, called Lenses. Everything about them, from
the way their society is structured to the way they deal
with strangers to the dreams they have for their own
future revolves around these Lenses. The result is an
alien culture that may not be deeply nuanced, but it is
a culture that is very easily remembered by players and
easily played by GMs. If you know that the two Lenses
for the alien race of Churq are Collectivity and Fear,
you know that a given Churq is going to be cowardly
and intensely social. Courageous individuality will be
noxious or incomprehensible to it and its social roles
will revolve around the safety of the collective against
the dreadful perils of the outside world.
Lenses should not be taken as the last word about
a species. GMs who want to spend more time on the
species’ psychology can elaborate as they wish, and all
of the guidelines given for a Lens can be easily adjusted
to whatever flavor the GM wishes to use. GMs can pick
or roll one or more Lenses from among the following
list, or generate their own as desired.

Collectivity
These aliens might be hive-like in their social structure,
natural communists, or simply very closely attached
to the customs and interests of their social group. The
importance of the individual is thought to be minimal,
and members will cheerfully and readily sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. To willfully refuse to
accept the consensus of the whole is an unspeakable
sin, and to be separated permanently from one’s social
group is a fate worse than death.
Curiosity
This species is insatiably curious, constantly prying into
the affairs of those around them. Spying for this race
carries no opprobrium whatsoever, and while they may
attempt to maintain privacy for certain doings, all assume it a given that matters will be discovered in the
end. They love to explore new places and meet new
sapients, and while they may be brutally indifferent to
the fates or treatment of these beings, they’re always
eager to observe them. Their societies tend to operate
in a profoundly transparent manner, and some view
the keeping of secrets as an automatic indication of
malicious intent.
Despair
These aliens have fallen prey to a pervasive sense of
failure and loss. Perhaps they are the remnants of a
once-glorious empire or the survivors of some cataclysmic disaster for their people. What they once loved
has been destroyed, and their sources of comfort and
courage have failed them. Superficially, they might resemble those species that crave pleasure and indulgence,
but their disports only serve to numb them to the existential gloom that taints the species. Their leadership
is desultory at best, and sophisticated social structures
tend to degrade into loose, diffident associations as
their members no longer have the hope necessary to
perpetuate them.
Domination
These aliens are consumed by a desire to conquer and
rule, both each other and any other species unfortunate
enough to share the stellar neighborhood. Some among
them can be fair and thoughtful rulers, but others are
nothing more than vainglorious tyrants. Among themselves, society tends to be organized in intricate and
clearly-marked hierarchies, with advancement progressing along both official and illicit routes. These
aliens constantly test their leaders, forcing them to
maintain their position through strength and cunning.
Faith
Such a species is driven by religious concerns, organizing their society around their faith and its clergy. Most
such species have a single faith. Others make do with a
number of different religions, all followed with a fierce
devotion. Challenges to this faith are not met with

Aliens •205
outrage so much as blank incomprehension; for these
beings, the truth of their religions is so self-evident
that it seems irrational to ever question it. Those who
most perfectly embody the teachings of their creeds
tend to become rulers, their lives and will taken as an
example for others.
Fear
These aliens live in constant fear. They may be natives
of some lethal death-world, survivors of a species-annihilating cataclysm, or simply evolved from weak and
easily-devoured prey animals. The world is terrifying
to them, and their societies are based around hiding
or protecting themselves from these dreads. The most
revered members are those who are best hidden or
best protected, and who can give protection and concealment to their fellows. Most of these races are quite
cowardly by human measure, but occasionally they can
be driven into a frenzy of terror in which they fight
with the courage of the doomed.
Gluttony
These aliens devour. They are rapacious consumers,
whether it is of food, living space, energy, or some other resource. They will do almost anything to increase
access to this resource and are deeply indifferent to the
needs of other species, and often of their own fellows
as well. To consume greatly is glorious for this species,
with the greatest and most respected members being
those who have the greatest stockpiles of the resource
to consume, or who provide the most to their followers.
The purpose of existence is to eat, and all good things
are understood as different modes of devouring.
Greed
These aliens are enormously greedy. Status depends almost entirely upon personal wealth, and their lives are
spent in accumulating the greatest stores of value possible. Some focus on production, creating the wealth for
their own benefit, while others seek to make a profit on
trade. Some such greedy species have intricate property
laws to safeguard what is accumulated, while others
are little more than bandits among their own kind, too
avaricious to let law interfere with their greed.
Hate
There is something these aliens hate, and it defines
their culture completely by their opposition to it. It
may be these aliens are rampant xenophobes, loathing all who are not of their own kind. There may be
acrid religious or political divisions among them, with
individuals identifying completely with their sect and
despising all the others. It could be an ancient enemy
among the stars, a rival race that has wounded them
so greatly as to be unforgivable. These aliens may spar
and maneuver for power among their own kind, but all
goals and individuals are to some degree subordinated
to the needs of their immortal hate.

Honor
Whatever sort of society the race has, it is one obsessed
with honorable behavior. Members will obey the social
mores and expectations of their roles at all costs. Personal sacrifice for the sake of upholding these principles
earns a member glory and esteem. Gaining advantage
by means of inappropriate behavior or failing in one’s
duty is shameful, and an entity that has compromised
its honor too greatly may prefer death to continued
existence.
Journeying
This species has an incurable wanderlust. Perhaps they
roam the stars in fleets of massive spike drive ships, or
they may make steady circuits of the nearby stars to
connect their worlds and exchange people among them.
More technologically primitive species might sail the
waves of alien seas or make nomadic journeys across
the continents of their world. Few of these aliens can
ever be happy in remaining in one place for long, and
they are forever scouting new worlds and new lands
simply for the pleasure of being there a little while.
Joy
These aliens are relentless bon vivants, constantly in
pursuit of pleasure and enjoyable excitement. Beauty,
grace, and the inspiration of passion are their highest virtues. Those who produce the most exquisite art
or inspire the most extravagant delight have effective
rule over their fellows, though such species tend to be
loosely-organized at best. The brute necessities of life
are acknowledged as a necessity, but their societies are
willing to sacrifice a great deal of efficiency and practicality for the sake of immediate satisfaction.
Pacifism
The race is remarkably peaceful and nonviolent in
nature. Few species survive while being totally averse
to violent self-defense, but this race will never choose
violence against living creatures as a means of gaining
advantage or retaliating to wrongs. Among their own
kind, violence is abhorrent and unnatural, and it is
probable that the species is either herbivorous or subsists by photosynthesis. A pacifist race may be peaceful, but there are more ways to do injury than through
personal violence; the cession of trade, the destruction
of property, and the incitement of divisions and confusion among their enemies are all tools this race knows
well. Pacifist species can also be quite oppressive at
times, with an underclass constitutionally incapable
of defending their possessions or privileges with force.
Pride
These aliens are suffused with an enormous pride in
their own culture and species, and instinctively consider themselves to be superior to the lesser beings they
may encounter. A prideful species is not necessarily a
hostile one; some such races have a certain sense of

206• Aliens
noblesse oblige toward their “lessers”, and some species’
pride shows in a resolute refusal to lower themselves
to deceit, cruelty, or avarice. More often, however, this
pride manifests in a casual contempt for the interests of
their inferiors, and a single-minded focus on personal
advancement and glory among their own kind.
Sagacity
These aliens love intellectual pursuits above all others.
Logic, wisdom, and erudition are all prized as the best
and most glorious expressions of their nature, and their
rulers are invariably sage-kings of remarkable depth
and breadth of understanding. Such understanding
does not necessarily stand in well for good judgment,
and sagacious alien civilizations are notorious for overreaching in their ambitions. Stupidity and ignorance
are moral failings to this race, and some of them treat
very harshly those species that they do not feel to be
their intellectual peers.
Subtlety
Such a species is enormously cunning and patient in
character, willing to endure years of suffering calmly
in order to bring about some intricate plan. They shun
open display of emotions or opinions, masking such
things behind protocols of bland correctness. To reveal
one’s true opinion about some contentious matter is
a mark either of profound trust or a sign of obvious
incipient treachery. The true ruler of such a species is
almost never who it seems to be.
Tradition
This species devoutly reveres the past and the ways of
their ancestors. Social interactions are stiffly ritualized,
and society is ornate with the customs, traditions, and
habits of their forebears. Innovations of any kind are
viewed with deep suspicion, and the most favored solutions to problems are those which have been employed
before. Members of this species are intensely uncomfortable when forced to exercise their own judgment,

and doing so in contravention to the past is almost impossible for them. Only when faced with a completely
novel situation is any degree of personal initiative likely
to be shown, and even in that case, the alien will try to
reconcile it to some existing tradition.
Treachery
This species is uniformly treacherous and untrustworthy. Bargains and agreements are kept only so long
as they are useful to both participants, and truthfulness
is simply a tool to be placed next to deceit. There is
no sense of acrimony or anger among these aliens at
the inevitable betrayals that make up their societies;
they consider it good and laudable that an individual should seek its own best interests, and those who
can most perfectly manipulate each other are naturally
those most worthy to rule, for the health of the society
directly influences the power of its head.
Tribalism
The aliens are fiercely tribal, divided up into myriad
small groups that are as often at war with each other
as they are cooperating. Such tribes tend to be built
along familial lines, though some tribes are volitional in
nature, representing different political or philosophical
groups. A given alien’s loyalty is to its tribe before its
species, and it is not uncommon for their enemies to
use one group against another.
Wrath
The race is hot-tempered, prone to fits of personal violence. Disputes are settled by force, though rarely to
the point of death among their own kind. Outsiders
can expect swift and bloody retaliation for any insult
or slight, and the prospect of death rarely intimidates
these beings. Their chief mode of emotional expression
is anger; wrath at obstacles, fury at enemies, and a slow
smoldering burn when neither are available.

Aliens •207

Alien Social Structure

Once the Lenses for a species are chosen, you’ll need
to establish a few important facts about the aliens. You
need to make some decisions about their social structure, the goals of their leadership, their relationship
with humanity, and the sort of examples that the PCs
are likely to encounter.
Determining the social structure for the aliens can
be done by answering a few basic questions and elaborating outward from the answers to whatever degree of
detail you find useful or enjoyable. In most cases, whatever social structure you hit on will apply only to those
aliens in a specific sector. Far-flung races might have
wildly different modes of rule among their different
fragments, assuming that biological necessity doesn’t
push them to certain kinds of societies.
First, decide how the species is ruled. You can roll
randomly on the table below, or simply pick something
that seems appropriate.
d8

Social Structure

1

Democratic

2

Monarchic

3

Tribal

4

Oligarchic

5-6

Multipolar Competitive

7-8

Multipolar Cooperative

Democratic: The species has a broadly democratic organization, with individual members having a
formal say in the choice of leadership. This voting need not necessarily be based on numbers; it
might be a vote with money, military power, religious influence, possession of certain biological
traits, or any other metric that makes sense to the
aliens. Whatever the specific currency, politics
for this race tends to revolve around persuasion
and diplomacy rather than use of military force to
determine species-wide policies.
Monarchic: The species is ruled by a single being, with
such rule justified by custom, biological imperative, divine mandate, personal influence, or familial ties. Such monarchic societies almost invariably
have a “noble” caste of some kind to act as administrators and officials for the monarch, and they usually make up the pool from which new monarchs
are chosen. The specific title for a monarch will
usually depend on the justification for their rule:
Chieftain, Emperor, Broodmother, High Priest,
Dictator, Chief Elder, or so forth.
Tribal: The species is organized into multiple tribes
based on lineage, philosophy, or geographical location. Tribes set their own laws and policies, and
are prone to intense internal struggles over resources and status. There may exist a “paramount
tribe” that inflicts its will upon the others through

brute strength or traditional esteem. Tribal leaders tend to be personally distinguished, and usually have earned their position through personal
accomplishments and the broad support of their
tribemates.
Oligarchic: The species is led by a number of powerful
or revered figures who work in nominal harmony.
Individual oligarchs might have their own goals,
but no single member has the strength to enforce
its will upon the whole. These oligarchs might be
the product of hereditary inheritance, or individual members of the species might one day aspire
to join their numbers.
Multipolar: The species has more than one leadership
organization. Roll 1d6; on a 1-2 it has two, 3-4
indicates three, and 5-6 indicates four. Roll on
this table the requisite number of times to determine the nature of these organizations. Some such
multipolar institutions operate in parallel; a tribal
organization headed by one gender, for example,
that determines the division of goods while a
monarchic head of a different gender makes decisions about the race’s relations with other species.
Others are directly in conflict, such as a monarchy
struggling against a democratic neighbor.
Once you’ve determined the type of leadership
the species favors, you can sort out any important
details about their social structures. By default, you
should assume that the aliens have some sort of analog for any job or role that humans find necessary.
The Churq might be cowardly collectivists, but even
they need plumbers, soldiers, and tax collectors. You
can take whatever human society suits you as the base
template and then interpret the relevant roles through
the Lenses you’ve picked for the species.
For example, if the Churq have the Lenses of Fear
and Collectivism, their tax collectors might be honored exemplars of communal redistribution, judiciously
taking from those who have excess in order to give to
those who have less. The Churq gladly offer resources
to the tax collector, because the offering proves that
they producing excess resources, which proves to them
that they are secure and safe in their plenty. A Churq
who fails to produce for the collective suffers gnawing
terror at the idea of dangerous scarcity and will redouble its effort to contribute to the group.
Conversely, Churq soldiers might invariably be
found in small groups, as an individual Churq is incapable of fighting effectively without the encouragement
and safety of their brethren around them. They might
specialize in terror attacks against enemy civilians, their
intimate acquaintance with fear encouraging them to
use it as a weapon against their enemies… their unarmed, noncombatant enemies, preferably. A war between Churq collectives might never have a single open
battle, but instead a sequence of ambushes and terror
attacks until one collective loses its nerve and submits.

208• Aliens

Alien Technology

Alien races tend to come in two different technological
flavors. Some are quite technologically primitive, either
through being too new to sapience to have had time
to develop scientific arts, or because they are unfortunate enough to inhabit a very resource-poor world.
Such aliens might demonstrate remarkable ingenuity
in making the most of their surroundings, but some
worlds make advancement prohibitively difficult for
a species.
Other aliens possess spike drives, advanced weaponry, fusion power, and all the other ornaments of a
sophisticated star-faring civilization. These aliens are
usually the remnants of a more expansionistic period,
colonies and outposts that have evolved into homeworlds for the survivors of the civilization. This golden age is normally terminated by some kind of species-wide disaster, whether natural in nature or the
result of savage internal warfare. These worlds are
usually too absorbed in their own affairs or ennui to
have much interest in expansion.
Most advanced aliens have tech roughly equivalent
to human TL4, though they’re often slightly superior
in some areas while being somewhat worse in others.
A few old, sophisticated races have the equivalent of
TL5, though these species often produce devices and
artifacts that are difficult for humans to use effectively.
A handful of alien worlds show technology that is simply impossible for humanity to replicate at any known
tech level, with artifices and creations that seem more
magic than mundane science.

Aliens in the Sector

What role do these aliens play in the sector? Do they
have their own sector homeworld, dominated by them
and their kind, or do they instead live in enclaves on
a human-ruled world? Do they live in orbital habitats,
or convoys of massive spike drive ships? You should
place the species according to your needs, preferably in
a location that the players can be expected to eventually
experience.
You should also make a few quick decisions about
how these aliens are generally treated by humans, and

how they treat humans in turn. Some dangerous or
obnoxious species might be unable to function in human societies, while others might be normal citizens
on a sophisticated pan-racial planet. Some beings might
be horrific or repellent to humans through no fault of
their own, and subject to persecution by those who
live around their “alien ghettos”. Such aliens are likely to respond to the misuse much as humans might,
albeit in ways strongly influenced by their Lenses. A
Wrathful species might respond with brutal violence
toward persecutors, while Joyful ones might try to win
their tormentors over by demonstrating the beauty and
delight they can bring to their friends.

Alien Motivation

Individual aliens are likely to have as wide and varying a set of motivations as any human. Alien governments and ruling institutions, however, are liable to
have more specific goals. Acquiring a new homeworld,
ensuring the suppression of would-be pogromchiks,
vengeance against a hated world or species, or any other such long-term goal would be suitable for an alien
government.
The broad goals of an alien government are usually
obvious, but the subtle plans and maneuvers they use to
accomplish these purposes can be less clear. PC groups
can be commissioned by alien officials to perform acts
or retrieve objects that have no immediate relevance,
only to discover later that they played a crucial role in
some enigmatic gambit. By the same token, they might
stumble across some alien operation that has no obvious purpose, earning bitter enmity for their disruption
of plans they never knew existed.
In either case, there should usually be some way
for the PCs to discover alien motivations, in the case
that they actually care. It can be prohibitively difficult
to negotiate with such beings without understanding
their desires, and parties with little appetite for combat
may be frustrated if they find their would-be counter-parties acting in an impenetrably obscure way. Some
adventures might revolve heavily around the challenge
of understanding an alien power’s true goals and the
steps they’re willing to take to achieve them.

Alien Player Characters •209

Alien Player Characters
If a GM decides to allow players to play members of an
alien race, she’s going to need to do a little extra work.
Each alien race is represented by a focus; to become
a member of that race, the player spends their initial
focus pick on choosing that origin. They then get the
natural benefits of belonging to that alien species.
As a general rule, the GM should pick two of the
following benefits to make up an alien’s origin focus, or
three if a couple of them are relatively minor perks. If
the Vree-Tak are a Proud Warrior Race of aliens, they
might have both an Aptitude for Violence, for example,
and an Origin Skill related to combat.
It’s also possible to apply particular weaknesses to
an alien species as compared to a human baseline. Such
weaknesses are rarely a significant game-balance consideration for PCs, however, as it’s common for players
to choose such alien races and then select classes and
roles that are unhindered by the species’ flaws. If you
want to use a flaw as a game-balance tool in a species,
make sure it’s broad enough to hinder a wide range of
concepts, and not just disqualify a few roles.
Aptitude for Violence
All members of this species are good at hurting things.
They gain a +1 bonus to their normal attack bonus.
Thus, a 1st level alien Expert would have an attack bonus of +1 instead of +0, and a 1st level Warrior would
begin with a +2 bonus.
Environmental Native
As a minor perk, the alien is able to survive in a relatively common hostile environment, such as underwater,
in hard vacuum, amid lethal radiation, or so forth. If the
alien requires this environment, it’s no net benefit at all.
Innate Ability
All members of this species have one or more natural
abilities beyond those possessed by humans. Perfect vision in the dark, tracking by scent, wireless tech interfacing, a lack of need for food and water, or some other
talent might apply. As a quick inspiration, you can look
at the equipment or cyberware list and give them the
natural use of 2-3 items. Optionally, you might give
them an ability equivalent to a single psionic technique,
plus one point of Effort to fuel it if needed.
Natural Defenses
The creature has a hard shell or sharp talons. The alien
has a base Armor Class of 15 plus half their character
level, rounded up. If you give them body weaponry
such as claws or fangs, have it equivalent to a medium advanced weapon. Weaponry alone is a very small
advantage, since it’s so easy to acquire otherwise, so
you might not count this as a benefit if all you give a
creature is a sharp set of teeth.

Origin Skill
All members of the species are particularly good at
something. They might all be capable warriors, have
unique technical aptitude, be persuasive speakers, or
otherwise have a shared knack. Receive an appropriate
skill as a bonus. Warrior-type races might be allowed
to pick from either Punch, Shoot, or Stab.
Psychic Aptitude
These aliens are all psychically gifted. The PC must
either be a Psychic or take the Partial Psychic class option from the Adventurer class. Their maximum Effort
score is increased by one point.
Shapeshifting
The alien is either an amoeboid blob that can manipulate objects with extruded pseudopods and flow
through small spaces, or it can actually mimic other
species or objects. The former trait is a minor benefit
at best, but the latter one might be sufficient to mimic
biopsionic shapeshifting, or might have a more restricted range of possible shapes.
Strong Attribute
All members of the species are strong, fast, tough, clever, perceptive, or charming by human standards. Pick
an attribute appropriate to the alien; that attribute
gains a +1 bonus to its modifier, up to a maximum of
+3. Thus, an alien from an exceptionally strong species
with a Strength score of 10 would have a Strength modifier of +1 instead of +0.
Tough
The alien is big, or hardy, or made of unusually durable
biological components. Whenever they roll their hit
dice to determine their maximum hit points, the first
die they roll always counts as the maximum. Thus, a
first level Warrior alien would always start with 8 hit
points. When rolling hit points at second level, they’d
count their first die as 8 and roll on from there. Further
hit dice that roll a 1 are rerolled.
Unusual Movement Mode
The alien can fly under normal gravity conditions, or
make short-range teleportation hops, or can climb
sheer walls as if they were flat. Whatever the details,
they can use their Move action to travel unusually.
Useful Immunity
The alien is impervious to some threat that’s relatively
common. A significant or common immunity, such as
against bullets, lasers, edged melee weapons or the like
would be a major benefit, while immunity to minor
threats such as toxins, diseases, radiation, or falling
damage might only qualify as a minor perk.

FACTIONS
Interstellar merchant combines, tyrannical planetary
empires, sinister cults of eugenic perfection… groups
such as these all have a role to play in Stars Without
Number. Such organized, motivated groups are known
as factions, and this chapter describes ways in which a
GM can use them to further events in a sector. Player
characters that attain sufficient power and fame might
even establish their own factions, and the rules below
give ways to handle inter-faction fighting and the advancement of each group’s goals.

Using Factions in Your Game

The faction system in Stars Without Number is intended
to provide a GM with a constant stream of background
activity, adventure hooks, and visible setting reactions
to PC actions. It is an optional system, one that a GM
can take or leave as their own campaign suggests, but
it can provide an interested GM with tools to simplify
the business of running the campaign’s background.
The faction system is not meant to be a standalone game that doesn’t require GM involvement. It’s
not balanced for equivalence between sides, isn’t designed to incentivize optimal play choices, and some
situations will certainly require a GM to referee them.
The system is, however, built to produce the kind of
output that a working GM is likely to find most useful.
Some GMs will have no use for a formalized faction system. These people feel most comfortable simply dictating the outcome of conflicts and ambitions
among the assorted groups and organizations in their
campaign. When two groups clash, the results will be
determined by what the GM thinks is most reasonable.
This is a perfectly valid way of doing things, and
indeed, when a GM decides how some off-stage organization interacts with a fully-statted faction they’re
going to have to make calls like that anyway. Yet the
disadvantages of such a method are twofold.
First, it lacks surprise for the GM. By definition,
the reasonable thing always happens, and even the
occasional randomizer tossed in produces results that
are to some degree predictable to the GM. History and
current affairs are full of wildly unlikely-seeming outcomes, however, and sometimes the GM can benefit
by seeing a genuinely shocking result percolate out of
some conflict. Even in the absence of the adventure
hooks such surprises create, not knowing exactly how
her campaign is going to shake out helps keep a GM
interested in events.
Second, an unstructured system has few prompts
to goad a GM into thinking of unexpected interactions
between factions. A GM simply provided with a list of
NPC groups to write events for will tend to reach for
the interactions and outcomes that are foremost in their
mind, implicitly going along with assumptions about
how things should play out. If instead they’re handed a

slow-burn struggle between a militant terrorist group
with fanatical zealots for an asset and a eugenics-loving
religion with a crack team of lawyers, they’re going to
think somewhat harder about how these two factions
might play out their conflict, and will get results that
don’t automatically feed their assumptions.
One of the easiest ways to use the faction system
is as a news chyron for your campaign. After each faction turn, you can boil down events to a few sentences
apiece and hand them to your players at the start of the
next gaming session, letting them know what’s on the
news channels and underground gossip boards of your
campaign. If your players get excited about one of the
events, you can dedicate the next downtime between
sessions to brewing up an adventure related to their
efforts at involvement.
Another use of the system is as a way to formalize
the setting reaction to PC actions. If the last adventure involved the PCs utterly discrediting the leader
of a political party you’re using as a faction, you might
scratch off the Demagogue asset that the party had that
represented that leader. A quick scribble gives you the
news crawl next session telling the PCs that the leader
had decided to step down to spend more time with
her family.
The factions you write up are not the only organizations and groups in your world, but they are the ones
the PCs are most likely to care about or the ones most
pertinent to their current activities. You don’t need to
keep the same factions active all the time; if the campaign shifts focus halfway across the sector, you can
simply freeze the local factions until the PCs get back in
their zone of relevance. If you have the spare time and
effort, you might even keep them running, letting the
PCs discover how things shook out when and if they
ever get back to that region of space.
In time, the PCs themselves can start creating their
own factions to contend with rivals and seek influence
on a scale impractical for a lone wanderer. While PC
factions use all the same rules and faction turn actions
as NPC ones, they have the tremendous advantage of
being the focus of a veteran adventuring party’s helpful
interest. Almost anything that can be accomplished by
faction turn actions can be done more quickly by the
appropriate PC adventures.
This, of course, is an easy way for a GM to let the
players write their own adventure content. So long as
the PCs care about their pet factions or allied groups,
their own ambitions and desire to help will practically
create whole sessions worth of adventure outlines for
you. Important NPCs in rival groups will become hated
nemeses, hostile assets will become the targets of their
bad intent, and the players will constantly be on the
lookout for ways to augment their allies. For the sake
of your own time and effort, you should let them.

212• Factions, Assets, and Turns

Factions, Assets, and Turns
A faction is any group that you intend to use as an important actor in the sector. In theory, any organization
could qualify as a faction; every planetary government,
business, religion, or club could be described with the
rules given here. Still, that kind of exhaustive cataloging is neither practical nor profitable. Faction status
should be reserved for those organizations that will do
things important to the PCs or the background world.
You should not bother creating more factions for your
game than you are actually using at that moment. Save
your effort for the groups that count.
It may be necessary to turn an organization into a
faction in the course of play. If the PCs suddenly take a
deep interest in a eugenic cult they recently faced on the
jungle moon of Perihelion, it might be useful for the
GM to turn the group into a formal faction, the better
to understand how the PCs might injure it and what
resources the cult might have to fight back. Or it might
be that the PC group’s interstellar trading cartel faction
tries to topple a world’s tyrannical government, thus
making it worthwhile to define the tyrant’s resources.
As a general rule, you shouldn’t have more than
five or six factions at the start of your campaign, and
fewer is quite possible. Fewer than three tend to make
for too much stability, however, and might not generate enough activity to make for interesting news
reports and adventure hooks. Possible factions in a
campaign might include criminal groups, local religions, planetary governments, political movements,
terrorist organizations, noble houses, or any other
band that might conceivably be someone the players
care about or some group that might possibly hire or
oppose the PCs.

Defining a Faction

Factions have attributes consisting of six statistics, a
homeworld, and one or more tags.
Hit points measure a faction’s cohesion, morale,
and group unity. The higher a faction’s hit points, the
harder it is to break it up. A faction that loses hit points
has lost cohesion somehow, either through the death
of leadership, the demoralization of members, or the
rise of fractious power blocs inside its structure. A faction needs time to recover from hit point damage. A
faction’s maximum hit points are based on its Force,
Cunning, and Wealth, as given later in the chapter.
Force rating is the faction’s general aptitude at applying physical violence, measured on a scale ranging
from 1 to 8. A rating of 1 implies an organization with
little or no aptitude for physical coercion, while a rating
of 8 might be appropriate for a regional hegemon with
a powerful, expansionist military. A high Force rating
doesn’t necessarily mean that the faction has much in
the way of a standing army, but it does mean that the
faction can think clearly about the use of force and is

accustomed to military reasoning. Governments tend
to have high Force ratings to represent police forces
and military structures. Terrorist groups, mercenary
bands, and other organizations that rely on brute violence also tend to have high Force ratings.
Cunning rating reflects the faction’s skills at espionage, infiltration, internal security, and covert
manipulation of other groups. A rating of 1 implies a
completely visible faction with no resources for resisting infiltration, while a rating of 8 implies a faction of
Illuminati unknown to all but a handful of paranoid
conspiracy-mongers with tendrils of influence reaching to the farthest star in the sector. Eugenics cults, terrorist groups, spy agencies, and some religious groups
tend to favor a good Cunning score.
Wealth rating indicates the faction’s commercial,
scientific, and industrial resources. A Wealth score of
1 means that the faction has little in the way of income
or investments, no dedicated manufacturing facilities,
and no laboratories or researchers available. A Wealth
score of 8 is appropriate for some system-spanning
merchant empire or the combine that runs the pretech
manufactories of an untouched factory world.
FacCreds are a measure of the faction’s general
wealth and resources, spent to purchase and maintain assets or carry out faction operations. A FacCred
doesn’t necessarily represent a certain sum of credits so
much as it represents logistics capability, available resources, and managerial focus. A faction on a primitive
world may not have a single credit to its name, but its
command of a legion of laborers and the food supplies
necessary to feed them are a vast store of FacCreds all
the same. All the credits in a sector do no good if they
can’t be effectively translated into a useful asset.
Factions also accumulate experience points. They
gain these points from accomplishing goals, with the
larger goals earning them correspondingly more experience points. Once enough experience is accumulated
the faction can spend it to improve a rating. The higher
the rating, the more experience is necessary to raise it.
It’s vastly more difficult to go from Force 7 to 8 than
from Force 1 to 2.
The faction’s homeworld represents the location
of its core leadership and support. Factions can always
purchase assets and take actions on their homeworld,
even if they lack any other assets there. By the same
token, an enemy can always launch attacks against the
faction on their homeworld if the enemy is able to
move in its own assets.
Tags are special traits that relate to the faction’s
nature or special aptitudes. A cabal of rebel conspirators might have the Secretive tag, which gives a bonus
to resisting certain attacks, or Deep Roots, which gives
them a bonus to operations on their homeworld. Most
factions have one or two tags.

Factions, Assets, and Turns •213

Faction Assets

Aside from the six statistics, faction also possess assets.
Assets are facilities, contacts, trained units of specialists,
or other specific objects, places, or groups of value. A
regiment of postech infantry is an asset, as is a pretech
manufactory, a master assassin, or an interstellar shipping company.
Assets require certain ratings to support. A fleet
of capital warships isn’t going to be useful to a faction
with Force 3 no matter how much wealth the faction
has. It just doesn’t have the infrastructure and institutional mindset to use such an asset effectively.
Assets have hit points much like factions do. An asset reduced to zero hit points by an attack is destroyed;
either physically ruined, hopelessly scattered, totally
demoralized, or lost to a rival buyer. Asset hit points
can be regained with time for repair, reorganization, or
culling members suborned by other powers.
Assets have a purchase cost and sometimes a maintenance cost, paid in FacCreds. The first turn that a
faction fails to pay the maintenance cost of an asset, it
becomes unavailable for use. If the maintenance cost
isn’t paid the next turn, the asset is lost.
Assets often have an Attack. When an asset is used
to strike at another faction, the attack entry is used to
determine what rating is attacked and the amount of
hit point damage that is done by a successful hit. An
asset without an Attack entry can’t be used to initiate
a strike at an enemy faction.
A Counterattack line indicates the damage an asset
does to an unsuccessful attacker. If an attacking asset
misses its strike against the target, the target’s Counterattack entry damage is done. An asset without a Counterattack entry does no damage to a failed attacker. It’s
quite possible to have an asset with no Attack but a
powerful Counterattack, making it useless at offense
but very dangerous to assault.
Assets have a type, such as “Special Forces”, “Military Unit”, “Facility”, “Starship” or the like. This type
is mostly relevant when factions wish to upgrade an
asset, or some special tag applies only to assets of a
certain type.
Assets have a location, usually the planet on which
they were purchased, though it might also be a deepspace habitat, a particular moon, or some other general
geographical location. Assets cannot be used against
different locations unless they are first transported
there, usually by means of a logistical asset.
Most assets also require a particular tech level to
purchase. They can be transported to worlds with lower tech levels, but they must be purchased on a planet
with a sufficient level of technology.
A faction may own no more assets of a particular
type than they have points in the relevant rating. Thus,
a faction with Force 3 can own three Force assets. In a
pinch, a faction can exceed this total, but each asset over
the maximum costs an additional FacCred in maintenance each turn.

The Faction Turn

Faction actions are divided up by turns. As a rule of
thumb, a faction turn happens once per month, or once
after each adventure. Turns might happen more or less
often depending on the GM’s preferred pace of events.
Each faction can usually take one action per turn.
At the beginning of each turn, roll a die that’s no
smaller than the number of factions you have. Thus, if
you’ve got six factions in the sector, roll a d6. If you’ve
got nine, roll a d10, and so forth. Whatever number
comes up is the faction that acts first; thus, if you roll
a 4, the fourth faction on your list acts first. Then the
one after it, and the one after that, and so forth, rolling
over the top of the list when necessary.
At the beginning of each turn, a faction gains FacCreds equal to half their Wealth rating rounded up plus
one-quarter of their total Force and Cunning ratings,
rounded down. Any maintenance costs must be paid
at the beginning of each turn. Assets that cannot be
maintained are unusable; an asset that goes without
maintenance for two consecutive rounds is lost. A faction cannot voluntarily choose not to pay maintenance.
If a faction has no goal at the start of a turn, they
may pick a new one. If they wish to abandon a prior
goal, they may do so, but the demoralization and confusion costs them that turn’s FacCred income and they
may perform no other action that turn.
At the end of each faction turn, the GM should
translate the turn’s events into a few lines of rumor or
news that can be related to the PCs. A successful attack
by the Lawyers of the Bright Dawn Guild on the Perihelion government’s Union Toughs might be reported
as “Neohuman rights activists on Perihelion applaud
the election of Parminder Smith to the leadership of the
government-sponsored Transit Workers Union. Miss
Smith is a strong supporter of neohuman research and
legal emancipation.”

Acting During A Turn

Factions can take several different types of actions,
though generally only one action per turn. The list
provided consists of the usual actions a faction might
find useful; you should feel free to allow variations on
the list depending on the particular situation. PC adventures always exist outside of the faction turn economy. If you run an adventure involving the PC group’s
destruction of the Sorority of the Golden Flame’s secret
laboratories on a volcanic planetoid, then the faction’s
asset is simply destroyed, with no chance of resisting.
A faction can only take one type of action per round,
but they can perform that action on as many worlds as
they wish. A faction that selects the Attack action, for
example, can launch attacks on multiple worlds, while
one that selects the Use Asset Ability action can use the
special abilities of any or all assets they possess. This
limit on the type of action allowed in a round tends
to slow down events, allowing for the more gradual
development of situations in play.

214• Faction Actions

Faction Actions
The following list of actions includes the most common activities a faction might choose to perform. The
GM should feel free to add new action types, or allow
alternate choices if a faction wishes to do something
that doesn’t quite fit the list below. As a rule, a faction
should only be able to do one thing per turn, but should
be able to do that same thing with any or all assets.
Attack: Attacking is the chief way by which a faction
assaults a rival’s assets and organizational structure. A successful attack can damage or destroy an
enemy asset, or even damage the leadership and
cohesion of an enemy faction. It’s up to the GM
or players to describe an attack and its methods.
Attacks can only be launched against known
assets. If a rival has stealthed assets on a world,
they cannot be targeted for an attack until they’ve
been discovered by a faction’s intelligence agents.
Attacks can only be launched against assets on the
same world as the attacker.
To launch an attack, the attacker selects one
or more of their own assets and targets a rival faction with assets on the same world. One at a time,
each attacking asset is matched against a defending
asset chosen by the defender. Each attacking asset
can attack only once per turn, though a defending
asset can defend as many times as the defender
wishes, assuming it can survive multiple conflicts.
Once matched, the attacker rolls 1d10 and
adds the relevant attribute for the asset. For example, a military unit’s Attack might add the faction’s
Force rating to the attack roll, while a cyberninja
unit might add the faction’s Cunning to the attack
roll. The defender then rolls 1d10 and adds the
attribute that the attack targets. In the instance of
the military unit, this might be an attack against
Force, causing the defender to add their Force
rating to the roll, while defending against the
cyberninjas might require adding the defender’s
Cunning rating. The Attack line of the attacking
asset indicates which attribute to add to the attack
roll and which to add to the defense roll.
If the attacker’s roll exceeds the defender’s roll,
the attack is a success. The defending asset suffers
damage as given on the Attack line of the attacking
asset. If the defender has a Base of Influence on the
world, the defender may opt to let the damage bypass the asset and hit the Base of Influence instead,
causing damage to it and the faction hit points. If
the asset or Base of Influence is reduced to zero
hit points, it is lost.
If the attacker’s roll is less than the defender’s
roll, the attack fails. The defending asset can apply
whatever damage their Counterattack line indicates to the attacking asset. If the defending asset

has no Counterattack line, the attacker suffers no
consequences for the failed attack.
A tie on the roll results in both Attack and
Counterattack succeeding. Both attacker and defender take damage as indicated.
Buy Asset: The faction buys one asset on their homeworld or another planet on which they have a
Base of Influence. These assets take time to assemble, and can neither attack, defend, nor grant
their special benefits until the beginning of the
faction’s next turn. The faction must have a sufficient rating to buy an asset, and the planet must
have a tech level sufficient to support the asset’s
creation. Only one asset can be purchased by a
faction per turn.
Change Homeworld: A faction can move to a different
homeworld, if they have a Base of Influence on
the destination planet. This action takes one turn,
plus one more for each hex of distance between
the old homeworld and the new. During this time
the faction can initiate no actions.
Expand Influence: The faction buys a Base of Influence
asset on a planet on which they have at least one
other asset. The faction then rolls 1d10+Cunning
rating against similar rolls by every other faction
on the planet. Any of the others that equal or
beat the faction’s roll may make a free immediate Attack action against the Base of Influence if
they wish. Other assets present on the planet may
defend against the attack as normal. The Base of
Influence cannot be used until the beginning of
the faction’s next turn.
To buy a Base of Influence, the purchaser pays
one FacCred for every hit point the base has, up
to a maximum equal to the faction’s maximum
hit points. Bases with few hit points are relatively
peripheral outposts, easy to dislodge but cheap to
erect. Bases with many hit points are significant
strongholds that would hurt the faction badly to
lose but are much harder to eliminate.
Factions may use this action to buy additional
hit points for a Base of Influence, paying one additional FacCred up to the maximum HP allowed. It
is possible to decrease a base’s hit points with the
action as well, albeit without refunds. The base on
a faction’s homeworld cannot be shrunk this way.
Refit Asset: Change one asset to any other asset of the
same type. If the new asset is of a more expensive
type, pay the difference. The asset must be on a
planet that allows the purchase of the new asset.
Turning a militia squad into elite skirmishers
requires a tech level 4 world and governmental
permission, for example. A refitted asset is unable to attack or defend until the beginning of the
faction’s next turn.

Faction Actions •215
Repair Asset/Faction: Heal damage to an asset or faction.
For one FacCred, an asset heals points of damage
equal to the faction’s score in its ruling attribute.
More damage can be healed in this single action,
but the cost of repair increases by one FacCred
for each further amount repaired- two FacCreds
for the second amount healed, three FacCreds for
the third amount healed, et cetera. If used to heal
a faction, the faction regains hit points equal to
the rounded average of its highest and lowest attribute ratings. This healing cannot be hurried by
additional spending. Use of this action allows the
faction to heal as many different assets as it wishes.
Sell Asset: Gain half the FacCred cost of the asset,
rounded down.
Seize Planet: The faction seeks to become the ruling
body of a world. The faction must destroy all
unstealthed assets on the planet belonging to factions who oppose their attempt before they can
successfully take control. If all the assets cannot be
destroyed in one turn, the faction must continue
the attempt next turn until either successful or all
of their own assets on that planet have been destroyed or have left the planet. No other actions
can be taken in the meanwhile. Once all resistance
has been crushed, the attacker must maintain at
least one unstealthed asset on the world for three
turns. If successful, they gain the Planetary Government tag for the world.
Use Asset Ability: Use the special abilities of one or
more assets, such as the transport ability of logistics assets, or the intelligence-gathering abilities
of spy assets.

Handling Special Cases

When in doubt, a GM should simply make a judgment
based on their own best sense of the situation. Despite
this general case, there are a few more particular situations that come up often enough to bear some specific
guidance in handling them.
Sometimes, a ground unit will choose to attack
a starship unit, or some other unit that seems to be
beyond their reach. As a general rule, you should allow
this, and simply decide how it was that the ground unit
was able to cause problems for the starships. Maybe
they subverted officers, or sabotaged support facilities,
or drove logistical suppliers out of business.
Some assets require the permission of the planetary government to raise them on a particular world or
move them into that world’s system. The necessity of
this will depend on how advanced the planetary government is and how direct the contact. A TL2 planetary
government probably wouldn’t even notice the arrival
of a capital fleet in their star system, let alone be able
to do anything to prevent it. Even so, native lawyers,
bribed offworlder officials, and hired mercenaries
might still be able to harass a force the locals couldn’t
bar from entering their territory.

Locations are considered general to a specific star
system rather than a particular world. The faction’s
marketers might be operating out of the planetary capital, but for purposes of location, they’re as much in the
system as a Scavenger Fleet floating around the rim.
Getting shuttles to and from wherever they need to go
inside the system is not a problem for most factions.
Sometimes two factions will want to merge for
some reason. The efficiency of this will depend on how
much the factions like each other and how close they
are in function; give this propinquity a rating from 1,
for two factions that hate each other and don’t do similar things at all, to 9, for two factions that are in perfect
synchrony. Use 6 for two factions of average similarity.
Whenever you need to see how well the merger went,
roll a compatibility check; 1d10 versus this number. If
the roll is equal or less, it worked, and if it’s higher, the
merger didn’t work so well in that regard.
Now determine the Force, Wealth, and Cunning
ratings for the new faction. For each one, roll a compatibility check; on a success, use the higher of the two
factions’ scores, while on a failure, use the lower one.
For each asset, roll a compatibility check; on a success, the asset belongs to the new faction, on a failure,
it’s forcibly sold. FacCreds are totaled between the two
factions, and the merged faction gets all the Bases of
Influence each originally had. Pick a new goal as well.
If the faction has assets its new ratings can’t support, it
keeps them, but can’t use Repair Asset on them.
PC adventures always overrule faction die rolls.
If the PCs undertake an adventure which results in
the crippling or destruction of a hostile faction’s asset,
that asset is destroyed without any need for dice. In
the same vein, if they swoop in to rescue some asset
that the dice declared was ruined and undertake an adventure that plausibly salvages the situation, that asset
comes back into existence. The faction system is built
to help create adventure hooks, not shut them down.
By the same token, if a PC adventure seems to
plausibly create an asset for a faction, then that should
be credited to the group. It is entirely in your interest
as a GM to let the players plot out adventure goals and
find motivation in helping a faction. Every adventure
they spend helping or harming a faction is one more
hook of engagement with the campaign world and one
less adventure idea you need to come up with.
If your factions are too quiet with a lack of interesting conflict among them, don’t hesitate to create that
conflict. A sector full of turtling factions that hide out
and painstakingly build their resources doesn’t make
for much engagement, so insert a personal grudge or
add a gold-rush opportunity.
When a faction buys an asset, they are not necessarily creating something ex nihilo. They might have
always had that particular resource, but are only now
mobilizing it effectively. A planetary government with
no military assets doesn’t necessarily lack an army, it
just lacks an army that is useful to its current goals.

216• Buying and Using Assets

Buying and Using Assets
Assets can be normally purchased on any world that has
a Base of Influence and sufficient tech level to support
their creation. In a few cases, however, acquiring an
asset requires more than just FacCreds and a planet.
Starship-type assets cannot be purchased on a
world with less than several hundred thousand inhabitants unless they can explain how the ships are being
provided or supported by another power. Planets with
very small populations lack such major infrastructure.
Some assets require the permission of a planetary
government in order to purchase them or move them
onto the planet. This is not a formality; the standing
government’s forces can physically disrupt any attempt
to recruit the asset on their world, or shoot it down in
its vulnerable entry phase. Whether or not this permission will be extended will usually depend on the faction’s relationship with a planet’s government, though
bribes of 1d4 FacCreds can occasionally suffice. Under
no conditions will a government willingly permit the
entry of assets powerful enough to overthrow them.
Planetary governments cannot prevent the landing of assets without the permission-needed quality.
Such assets are too unthreatening and nondescript to
alert them until after they’ve already been formed or
have landed. Of course, there is nothing stopping them
from attacking these assets either directly or indirectly
should they feel threatened.
Only one asset can be purchased per turn by a
given faction, and assembling it takes time. The asset
can neither attack, defend, nor give any special benefits
until the beginning of the buyer’s next turn.

Using Faction Assets

As its action for the turn, a faction can choose to use the
special actions of one or more assets. They can trigger
these special abilities in any order, but each form of asset must be used all at the same time; you cannot trigger
Heavy Drop Assets to move a Monopoly asset onto a
world, activate the Monopoly ability to siphon cash,
and then use another Heavy Drop Asset to move the
Monopoly back offworld. All Heavy Drop Assets must
be finished before Monopolies can be triggered, and
so forth. Unless specified otherwise, all asset targets
must be in the same stellar system with the acting assets.
In some cases, assets are called to make a test
against another faction, such as a Cunning vs. Wealth
test. For these tests, the acting asset’s faction rolls 1d10
and adds their score in the acting attribute, while the
target faction rolls 1d10 and adds their score in the defending attribute. If the actor rolls higher than the defender, the action is successful. Certain tags may grant
a faction extra dice for these rolls, in which case the
highest d10 out of those rolled is used. These tests do
not count as attacks, and no damage or counterattacks
are triggered.

Bases of Influence

Bases of Influence are special assets, and use certain
special rules. A faction cannot buy assets on a world
without a Base of Influence, though it can move assets
purchased elsewhere onto the planet, and it can always
buy assets on its homeworld even if its Base of Influence there is destroyed. Of course, that assumes it still
has a Base of Influence somewhere else.
First, a faction can only ever have one Base of Influence on a world at a time. Bases of Influence cannot
be moved once in place. Bases of Influence cannot be
purchased with a Buy Asset action. They can only be
put in place with an Expand Influence action. Bases of
Influence have a sale value of zero FacCreds.
The cost of a Base of Influence is equal to its maximum hit points, which can be up to the owning faction’s maximum hit points. Bases of Influence do not
count against a faction’s maximum assets.
Damage done to a Base of Influence is also done
directly to a faction’s hit points. If a Base of Influence
is brought below zero hit points, the overflow damage
is not counted against the owning faction’s hit points.
As a consequence, a faction must decide how heavily to invest in a particular Base of Influence. A minor
foothold on a world consisting of a base with few hit
points is cheap and risks limited harm to the faction
should it be destroyed, but it’s also more vulnerable to
being wiped out by a rival group.
It’s quite possible for a faction to be effectively
destroyed by smashing enough heavily-invested Bases
of Influence on other worlds. While the homeworld’s
Base might be in perfect condition, the faction has so
badly overextended itself in failed expansion that it
can no longer sustain itself as a going concern. The
resources and personnel that the homeworld needed
to import are no longer available, and the credits and
effort spent on the now-destroyed Bases are wasted.
The backlash from this can be ruinous to any faction.
Every faction also has a homeworld. A homeworld
is always automatically equipped with a Base of Influence with maximum hit points. If a faction moves its
homeworld to a planet that already has a Base of Influence, the base on the new homeworld has its hit points
set to the maximum possible and the homeworld’s Base
of Influence swaps in the hit point value that the destination world’s base originally had.

Faction Goals •217

Faction Goals
Factions usually have motivations and goals beyond
simple existence. To grow, a faction needs to accomplish goals that are in line with their leadership’s purposes. Successful achievement of these goals helps the
faction grow in strength and influence.
A faction can pursue one goal at a time. Once a goal
is successfully attained, the faction may select a new
one at the beginning of their next turn or delay until a
good opportunity arises. If a faction chooses to abandon a goal, the demoralizing effect of it and the waste
of preparations costs them that turn’s FacCred income,
and they cannot perform any other action that turn.
A faction that successfully accomplishes a goal
gains experience points equal to the goal’s difficulty.
This experience may be saved, or spent at the beginning
of any turn to increase the Force, Cunning, or Wealth
ratings of a faction. Optionally, the GM might allow a
faction to buy a new tag if their deeds justify it.
It’s the GM’s choice as to what might constitute
an appropriate goal for a faction, but below are some
potential goals and the difficulties attached to each.
Military Conquest: Destroy a number of Force assets of
rival factions equal to your faction’s Force rating.
Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets destroyed.
Commercial Expansion: Destroy a number of Wealth
assets of rival factions equal to your faction’s
Wealth rating. Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets
destroyed.
Intelligence Coup: Destroy a number of Cunning assets
of rival factions equal to your faction’s Cunning
rating. Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets destroyed.
Planetary Seizure: Take control of a planet, becoming
the legitimate planetary government. Difficulty
equal to half the average of the current ruling
faction’s Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings. If
the planet somehow lacks any opposing faction to
resist the seizure, it counts as Difficulty 1.
Expand Influence: Plant a Base of Influence on a new
planet. Difficulty 1, +1 if the attempt is contested
by a rival faction.
Blood the Enemy: Inflict a number of hit points of damage on enemy faction assets or bases equal to your
faction’s total Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings.
Difficulty 2.
Peaceable Kingdom: Don’t take an Attack action for four
turns. Difficulty 1.
Destroy the Foe: Destroy a rival faction. Difficulty equal
to 1 plus the average of the faction’s Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings.
Inside Enemy Territory: Have a number of stealthed
assets on worlds with other planetary governments equal to your Cunning score. Units that
are already stealthed on worlds when this goal is
adopted don’t count. Difficulty 2.

Invincible Valor: Destroy a Force asset with a minimum purchase rating higher than your faction’s
Force rating. Thus, if your Force is 3, you need to
destroy a unit that requires Force 4 or higher to
purchase. Difficulty 2.
Wealth of Worlds: Spend FacCreds equal to four times
your faction’s Wealth rating on bribes and influence. This money is effectively lost, but the goal
is then considered accomplished. The faction’s
Wealth rating must increase before this goal can
be selected again. Difficulty 2.

Raising Faction Stats

Faction attributes can be raised at the beginning of
each turn, if enough experience points are available.
The cost of raising a faction attribute rises as the rating
rises. As a faction’s ratings improve, it becomes harder
to destroy, and gains additional maximum hit points.
The maximum hit points of a faction are equal to 4
plus the experience point cost of the highest attributes
in Force, Cunning, and Wealth they have attained.
For example, a faction with Force 3, Cunning 2, and
Wealth 2 has a maximum hit point total of 4 + 4 + 2
+ 2 = 12 hit points. A brand-new faction with Force 1,
Cunning 2, and Wealth 1 has a maximum hit point total
of 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8 hit points.
Experience points spent by factions differ from
those gained by PCs in that they are lost when they increase an attribute. Once a faction spends 4 XP to raise
Force from 2 to 3, for example, those points are lost,
and 6 more must be spent to raise Force from 3 to 4.

218• Cunning Assets

Cunning Assets
Base of Influence: This asset is special, and is required
for purchasing or upgrading units on a particular
world. Any damage done to a Base of Influence is
also done to a faction’s hit points. The cost of a
Base of Influence equals its maximum hit points,
which can be any number up to the total maximum hit points of its owning faction. A faction’s
bases of influence don’t count against their maximum assets. A Base of Influence can only be purchased with the Expand Influence action.
Blackmail: Selectively degrade the effectiveness of an
asset. Any attempt to attack or defend against
Blackmail loses any bonus dice earned by tags.
Boltholes: Equipped with a number of postech innovations to make cleaning them out a costly and
dangerous pursuit. If a faction Special Forces
or Military Unit asset on the same planet as the
Boltholes suffers damage sufficient to destroy it,
it is instead set at 0 HP and rendered untouchable
and unusable until it is repaired to full strength.
If the Boltholes are destroyed before this happens,
the asset is destroyed with them.
Book of Secrets: Exhaustively cataloged psychometric
records on important and influential local figures,
allowing uncanny accuracy in predicting their actions. Once per turn, a Book of Secrets allows the
faction to reroll one die for an action taken on
that world or force an enemy faction to reroll one
die. This reroll can only be forced once per turn,
no matter how many Books of Secrets are owned.
Covert Shipping: Quiet interstellar asset transport. Any
one Special Forces unit can be moved between any
worlds within three hexes of the Covert Shipping
at the cost of one FacCred.
Covert Transit Net: Facilities web an area of space with
a network of smugglers and gray-market freighter
captains. As an action, any Special Forces assets
can be moved between any worlds within three
hexes of the Covert Transit Net.
Cracked Comms: A cryptographic asset for the interception and deciphering of enemy communications. Friendly fire can be induced with the right
interference. If the Cracked Comms succeeds in
defending against an attack, it can immediately
cause the attacking asset to make an attack against
itself for normal damage or counterattack results.
Cyberninjas: Outfitted with the latest in personal
stealth cyberware, cyberninjas are designed to
avoid all but the most careful scans.
Demagogues: Popular leaders of a particular faith or
ideology that can be relied upon to point their
followers in the direction of maximum utility.
False Front: This asset allows a faction to preserve more
valuable resources. If another asset on the planet
suffers enough damage to destroy it, the faction

can sacrifice the false front instead to nullify the
killing blow.
Informers: Minions that lace a planet’s underworld,
watchful for intruders. They can choose to Attack
a faction without specifying a target asset. On a
successful Cunning vs. Cunning attack, all Stealthed assets on the planet belonging to that faction
are revealed. Informers can target a faction even if
none of their assets are visible on a world; at worst,
they simply learn that there are no stealthed assets.
Lobbyists: Usable to block the governmental permission that is sometimes required to buy an asset or
transport it into a system. When a rival faction
gains permission to do so, the Lobbyists can make
an immediate Cunning vs. Cunning test against
the faction; if successful, the permission is withdrawn and cannot be re-attempted until next turn.
Organization Moles : These can subvert and confuse
enemy assets, striking to damage their cohesion.
Panopticon Matrix: These facilities weave braked-AI
intelligence analysts into a web of observation
capable of detecting the slightest evidence of intruders on a world. Every rival Stealthed asset on
the planet must succeed in a Cunning vs. Cunning
test at the beginning of every turn or lose their
Stealth. The owner also gains an additional die
on all Cunning attacks and defenses on that planet.
Party Machines: Political blocks control particular cities
or regions… blocks that are firmly in control of
the faction. Each turn, a Party Machine provides
1 FacCred to its owning faction.
Popular Movements: A planet-wide surge of enthusiasm
for a cause controlled by the faction. This support pervades all levels of government, and the
government always grants any asset purchase or
movement requests made by the faction.
Saboteurs: Minions rained in launching strikes against
enemy operations. An asset attacked by saboteurs
cannot apply any Use Asset Ability action until the
start of the attacking faction’s next turn. This applies whether or not the attack was successful.
Seditionists: These asset sap a target’s loyalty and will to
obey. For a cost of 1d4 FacCreds, the Seditionists
can attach themselves to an enemy asset. Until
they attach to a different asset or no longer share
the same planet, the affected asset cannot attack.
If the asset is destroyed, the Seditionists survive.
Seductresses: They and their male equivalents subvert
the leadership of enemy assets. As an action, a Seductress can travel to any world within one hex.
As an attack, a Seductress does no damage, but an
asset that has been successfully attacked immediately reveals any other Stealthed assets of that
faction on the planet. Only Special Forces units
can attack a Seductress.

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means
that the asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset has a special feature or cost.
Smugglers: Men and women skilled in extracting personnel. For one FacCred, the smugglers asset can
transport itself and/or any one Special Forces unit
to a planet up to two hexes away.
Stealth: Not an asset, per se, but a special quality that
can be purchased for another Special Forces asset
on the planet. An asset that has been Stealthed
cannot be detected or attacked by other factions.
If the unit normally requires the permission of a
planetary government to be moved onto a planet,
that permission may be foregone. An asset loses
its Stealth if it is used to attack or defend.
Transport Lockdown: These techniques involve selective pressure on local routing and shipping companies. On a successful Cunning vs. Cunning attack against a rival faction, the rival faction cannot

transport assets onto that planet without spending
1d4 FacCreds and waiting one turn.
Treachery: Traitors can attack an enemy asset. On a
successful attack, the Treachery asset is lost, 5 FacCreds are gained, and the targeted asset switches
sides to join the traitor’s faction, even if the faction
does not otherwise have the attributes necessary.
Tripwire Cells: These observers are alert to the arrival of stealthed units. Whenever a stealthed asset
lands or is purchased on a planet with tripwire
cells, the Cells make an immediate Cunning vs.
Cunning attack against the owning faction. If successful, the asset loses its stealth.
Vanguard Cadres: Followers of the movement are inspired sufficiently to take up arms and fight on
behalf of their leadership.

220• Force Assets

Force Assets
Base of Influence: This asset is special, and is required
for purchasing or upgrading units on a particular
world. Any damage done to a Base of Influence is
also done to a faction’s hit points. The cost of a
Base of Influence equals its maximum hit points,
which can be any number up to the total maximum hit points of its owning faction. A faction’s
bases of influence don’t count against their maximum assets. A Base of Influence can only be purchased with the Expand Influence action.
Beachhead Landers: A collection of short-range,
high-capacity spike drive ships capable of moving
large numbers of troops. As an action, the asset
may move any number of assets on the planet, including itself, to any world within one hex at a cost
of one FacCred per asset moved.
Blockade Fleets: A ragtag lot of corsairs, pirates, privateers, and other deniable assets. When they successfully Attack an enemy faction asset, they steal
1d4 FacCreds from the target faction as well. This
theft can occur to a faction only once per turn,
no matter how many blockade fleets attack. As an
action, this asset may also move itself to a world
within one hex.
Capital Fleets: The pride of an empire, this is a collection of massive capital warships without peer in
most sectors. Capital fleets are expensive to keep
flying, and cost an additional 2 FacCreds of maintenance each turn. As an action, they may move
to any world within three hexes of their current
location. Planetary government permission is required to raise a capital fleet, but not to move one
into a system.
Counterintel Units: These security units specialize in
code breaking, internal security, and monitoring
duties. They can crack open enemy plots long before they have time to come to fruition.
Cunning Traps: This asset covers all the myriad stratagems of war, from induced landslides to spreading
local diseases.
Deep Strike Landers: These advanced transport ships
are capable of moving an asset long distances. As
an action, any one non-Starship asset, including
itself, can be moved between any two worlds
within three hexes of the deep strike landers, at a
cost of 2 FacCreds. This movement can be done
even if the local planetary government objects, albeit doing so is usually an act of open war.
Elite Skirmishers: These lightly-equipped troops are
trained for guerrilla warfare and quick raids.
Extended Theater: These facilities allow for transporting assets long distances. As an action, any one
non-Starship asset, including itself, can be moved
between any two worlds within two hexes of the
extended theater, at a cost of 1 FacCred.

Gravtank Formations: These tank formations are composed of advanced postech gravtank units that are
capable of covering almost any terrain and cracking even the toughest defensive positions.
Guerrilla Populace: Such assets reflect popular support
among the locals and a cadre of men and women
willing to fight as partisans.
Hardened Personnel: These are the employees and support staff of the faction that have been trained in
defensive fighting and equipped with supply caches and hardened fallback positions.
Heavy Drop Assets: These craft allow for the transport
of resources from one world to another. As an
action, any one non-Starship asset, including this
one, may be moved to any world within one hex
for one FacCred.
Hitmen: Crudely-equipped thugs and assassins with
minimal training that have been aimed at a rival
faction’s leadership.
Integral Protocols: A complex web of braked-AI supported sensors and redundant security checks used
to defeat attempts to infiltrate an area. They can
defend only against attacks versus Cunning, but
they add an additional die to the defender’s roll.
Militia Units: Groups of lightly-equipped irregular
troops with rudimentary military training but no
heavy support.
Planetary Defenses: Massive mag cannons and gravitic braker gun arrays designed to defend against
starship bombardments and repel unauthorized
landing. Planetary defenses can only defend
against attacks by Starship-type assets.
Postech Infantry: The backbone of most planetary
armies, these well-trained soldiers are usually
equipped with mag weaponry and combat field
uniforms, and have heavy support units attached.
Pretech Infantry: The cream of the stellar ground
forces, elite troops kitted out in the best pretech
weaponry and armor available, with sophisticated
heavy support weaponry integral to the unit.
Pretech Logistics: These assets represent caches, smugglers, or internal research and salvage programs.
As an action, a pretech logistics asset allows the
owner to buy one Force asset on that world that
requires up to tech level 5 to purchase. This asset
costs half again as many FacCreds as usual, rounded up. Only one asset can be purchased per turn.
Psychic Assassins: Combat-trained psychics equipped
with advanced pretech stealth gear and psitech
weaponry. Psychic assassins automatically start
Stealthed when purchased.
Security Personnel: Standard civilian guards or policemen, usually equipped with nonlethal weaponry
or personal sidearms.

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means
that the asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset has a special feature or cost.
Space Marines: Heavily-armored specialist troops
trained for ship boarding actions and opposed
landings. As an action, they can move to any world
within one hex of their current location, whether
or not the planetary government permits it.
Strike Fleets: Forces composed of frigate or cruiser-class
vessels equipped with space-to-ground weaponry
and sophisticated defenses against light planetary
weaponry. As an action, they can move to any
world within one hex of their current location.
Zealots: Members of the faction so utterly dedicated
that they are willing to launch suicide attacks or
hold positions to the death. Zealots take 1d4 damage every time they launch a successful attack or
perform a counterattack.

Eliminating Force Assets
It’s important to remember that a disabled or damaged Force asset hasn’t necessarily been blown to
pieces on a battlefield. When thinking of ways that
a conflict might have harmed such an asset, remember that demoralization, confusion, subversion, and simple lack of upkeep might all cripple
the effectiveness of an asset, or even destroy it as
an effective force without rebuilding as expensive
as buying a fresh asset. A navy with spacemanship
skills so neglected as to constantly run ships into
each other is just as worthless to its owning faction
as a fleet of smoking wrecks, and the only damage
done there was to the organization’s focus.

222• Wealth Assets

Wealth Assets
Bank Assets: Once per turn, the faction can ignore one
cost or FacCred loss imposed by another faction.
This does not require an action. Multiple bank assets allow multiple losses to be ignored.
Base of Influence: These follow the standard rules for
Bases of Influence.
Blockade Runners: These starship captains excel at
transporting goods through unfriendly lines. As
an action, a blockade runner can transfer itself or
any one Military Unit or Special Forces to a world
within three hexes for a cost of two FacCreds.
They can even move units that would otherwise
require planetary government permission to enter.
Commodities Brokers: They substantially lessen the
cost of large-scale investments by timing materials purchases properly. As an action, the owner
of a commodities broker can roll 1d8; that many
FacCreds are subtracted from the cost of their next
asset purchase, down to a minimum of half normal price, rounded down.
Franchise: This asset reflects a deniable connection
with a local licensee for the faction’s goods and
services. When a Franchise successfully attacks a
enemy asset, the enemy faction loses one FacCred
(if available), which is gained by the Franchise’s
owner. This loss can happen only once a turn, no
matter how many Franchises attack.
Freighter Contract: A special link with heavy shipping
spacers. As an action, the faction may move any
one non-Force asset, including this one, to any
world within two hexes at a cost of one FacCred.
Harvesters: These gather the natural resources of a
world, whether ore, biologicals, or other unprocessed goods. As an action, the Harvesters’ owning
faction may roll 1d6. On 3+, gain one FacCred.
Hostile Takeover: This asset can seize control of damaged and poorly-controlled assets. If a Hostile
Takeover does enough damage to destroy an asset, the target is instead reduced to 1 hit point and
acquired by the Hostile Takeover’s owning faction.
Laboratory: The lab allows a world to make hesitant
progress in tech. The presence of a Laboratory
allows assets to be purchased on that world as if it
had Tech Level 4.
Lawyers: Sophists in immaculate suits or charismatic
tribal skalds, lawyers have the ability to tie an enemy up in the coils of their own internal rules, damaging assets with confusion and red tape. Lawyers
cannot attack or counterattack Force assets.
Local Investments: These give the faction substantial influence over the commerce on a world. Any other
faction that tries to buy an asset on that planet
must pay one extra FacCred. This money is not
given to the investments’ owner, but is lost. This
penalty is only applied once.

Marketers: Deployed to confuse enemy factions into
untimely investments. As an action, the marketers
may test Cunning vs. Wealth against a rival faction’s asset. If successful, the target faction must
immediately pay half the asset’s purchase cost,
rounded down, or have it become disabled and
useless until this price is paid.
Medical Center: Salvage and repair damaged assets.
Once between turns, if a Special Forces or Military Unit asset on the world is destroyed, the faction may immediately pay half its purchase cost
to restore it with one hit point. Any Repair Asset
action taken on that world costs one less FacCred
for Special Forces and Military Units.
Mercenaries: Groups of well-equipped, highly-trained
soldiers willing to serve the highest bidder. Mercenaries have a maintenance cost of one FacCred
per turn. As an action, Mercenaries can move to
any world within one hex of their current location.
To purchase or move a Mercenary asset to a planet
requires government permission.
Monopoly: An open or tacit stranglehold on certain vital
businesses or resources on a world. As an action,
owners of a monopoly may force one other faction
with unstealthed assets on that world to pay them
one FacCred. If the target faction can’t pay, they
lose one asset of their choice on the world.
Postech Industry: As an action, the owning faction can
roll 1d6 for a Postech Industry asset. On a 1, one
FacCred is lost, on a 2-4 one FacCred is earned,
and a 5-6 returns two FacCreds. If money is lost
and no resources are available to pay it, the Postech Industry is destroyed.
Pretech Manufactories: Rare, precious examples of
functioning pretech industrial facilities, retrofitted to work without the benefit of specialized psychic disciplines. As an action, the owning faction
can roll 1d8 for a Pretech Manufactory, and gain
half that many FacCreds, rounded up.
Pretech Researchers: A highly versatile team of research
and design specialists capable of supporting limited pretech… as long as they’re adequately funded. Any world with Pretech Researchers on it is
treated as tech level 5 for the purpose of buying
Cunning and Wealth assets. Pretech researchers
have a maintenance cost of 1 FacCred per turn.
R&D Departments: These allow the smooth extension
of wealth-creation and industrial principles to the
farthest reaches of the faction’s operations. A faction with an R&D department may treat all planets as having tech level 4 for purposes of buying
Wealth assets.
Scavenger Fleets: These rag-tag armadas bring enormous technical and mercantile resources to their
patrons, along with a facility with heavy guns. As

an action, a Scavenger Fleet can be moved to any
world within three hexes. Scavenger Fleets cost 2
FacCreds a turn in maintenance.
Shipping Combine: Transport large amounts of equipment and personnel between worlds. As an action,
the combine may move any number of non-Force
assets, including itself, to any world within two
hexes at a cost of one FacCred per asset.
Surveyors: Explore potential resource and investment
options on worlds. The presence of a Surveyor
crew allows one additional die to be rolled on
Expand Influence actions. As an action, a surveyor
crew can be moved to any world within two hexes.
Transit Web: These facilities allow almost effortless relocation of all assets. For one FacCred, any number of non-starship Cunning or Wealth assets may

be moved between any two worlds within three
hexes of the Transit Web. This may be done freely
on the owner’s turn so long as the fee can be paid,
and using the ability doesn’t require an action.
Union Toughs: These bruisers don’t much like scabs and
management, and they’re willing to take the faction’s word on which people are which. They’re
lightly armed and poorly trained, but they can infiltrate to perform sabotage.
Venture Capital: This asset grows resources out of
seemingly nowhere, harvesting the best of entrepreneurship for the faction’s benefit. As an action,
venture capital can be tapped. 1d8 is rolled; on a 1,
the asset is destroyed, while on a 2-3 one FacCred
is gained, 4-7 yields two FacCreds and 8 grants
three FacCreds.

224• Faction Tags

Faction Tags
Most factions have some unique quality about them,
some trait that distinguishes them from other factions
of similar resources. Whether a particularly fanatical
band of ideological crusaders or an ancient order of
pacifistic scientists, faction tags allow a GM to give a
group a few special tricks of their own.
A faction should generally be given one tag, or two
at the most for particularly versatile organizations. The
exception is the Planetary Government tag, which can
be acquired– and lost– multiple times to reflect the
faction’s seizure of new worlds. Factions tags do not
normally change without some drastic and organization-shaping event.
Colonists
This faction is a fresh colony on an otherwise largely
untouched planet. It is this brave band of pioneers that
will tame the world’s wild forces and bring forth a better life for those who come after.
Effect: This faction has all the benefits of the Planetary
Government tag for its homeworld, as no other
government exists on a fresh colony. The faction’s
homeworld is also treated as if it had at least tech
level 4. Colonies with fewer than 100,000 citizens lack the necessary industrial infrastructure
to build Spaceship-type assets.
Deep Rooted
This faction has been part of a world’s life for time out
of mind. Most natives can hardly imagine the world
without this faction’s presence, and the traditional prerogatives and dignities of the group are instinctively
respected.
Effect: This faction can roll one additional d10 when
defending against attacks on assets on their homeworld. If the faction ever changes homeworlds,
this tag is lost.
Eugenics Cult
The forbidden maltech secrets of advanced human genetic manipulation are known to this faction, and they
use them with gusto. Slave-engineered humanoids and
“deathless” leadership are just two of the more common
alterations these unstable scientists undertake.
Effect: Eugenics Cultists can buy the Gengineered
Slaves asset; it’s an asset requiring Force 1 with
the statistics of 6 HP, 2 FacCred cost, tech level 4
required, with an Attack of Force vs. Force/1d6
damage and a Counterattack of 1d4 damage. Once
per turn, the Eugenics Cult can roll an extra d10
on an attack or defense by a Gengineered Slaves
asset, regardless of the stat being used. Gengineered Slaves can count as either a Military Unit
or Special Forces, determined when the cult first
creates a specific asset.

Exchange Consulate
This faction is either led through an Exchange Consulate or has close ties with that pacifistic society of
bankers and diplomats. The sophisticated economic
services they provide strengthen the faction.
Effect: When the faction successfully completes a
“Peaceable Kingdom” Goal, they may roll 1d6; on
a 4+, they gain a bonus experience point. Once
per turn, the faction may roll an extra d10 when
defending against a Wealth attack.
Fanatical
The members of this faction just don’t know when to
quit. No matter how overmatched, the members will
keep fighting to the bitter end- and occasionally past it.
Effect: The faction always rerolls any dice that come up
as 1. This zealousness leaves them open at times,
however; they always lose ties during attacks.
Imperialists
This faction nurses wild dreams of controlling the sector, whether out of an impulse to bring their local culture and technology to less fortunate worlds or simple
lust for dominion. They excel at defeating planetary
defenses and standing armies.
Effect: This faction may roll an extra d10 for attacks
made as part of a Seize Planet action.
Machiavellian
This faction’s meat and drink is intrigue, its members
delighting in every opportunity to scheme. It may be
a secret cabal of hidden masters or the decadent court
of a fallen stellar empire, but its membership has forgotten more of treachery than most others ever learn.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional
d10 when making a Cunning attack.
Mercenary Group
The faction sells its services to the highest bidder, and
is an extremely mobile organization. Vast amounts of
men and material can be moved interstellar distances
in just a few months.
Effect: All faction assets gain the following special ability: As an action, the asset may move itself to any
world within one hex.
Perimeter Agency
This faction is or is closely tied to an Agency of the
enigmatic Perimeter organization. Originally organized by the Terran Mandate to detect and contain
maltech outbreaks until Mandate fleet resources could
be dispatched, the Perimeter retains numerous ancient
override codes for pretech security protocols.
Effect: Once per turn, the faction may roll an additional d10 when making an attack against an asset

Faction Tags •225
that requires tech level 5 to purchase. The faction
may roll an extra die when making a test to detect
Stealthed assets.
Pirates
This faction is a scourge of the spacelanes, driving up
the cost of shipping and terrorizing merchant captains
without pity. They steal and refit ships with vicious
ingenuity, cobbling together space armadas out of the
leavings of their prey.
Effect: Any movement of an asset onto a world that has
a Base of Influence for this faction costs one extra
FacCred, paid to this faction.
Planetary Government
This faction is the legitimate government of a planet.
Rebel groups and rival factions may have assets on the
planet, but control over the instruments of the state
is firmly in this faction’s hands. The faction may rule
openly, or it may simply have an inexorable grasp on
the existing authorities.
Effect: The faction’s permission is required to buy or
import those assets marked as needing government permission. This tag can be acquired multiple times, once for each planet the faction controls.
Plutocratic
This faction prizes wealth, and its membership strives
constantly to expand and maintain personal fortunes.
Perhaps it is a ruling council of oligarchs or a star-spanning trade cartel.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional
d10 when making a Wealth attack.
Preceptor Archive
This faction is or has close ties to a Preceptor Archive
a place of learning operated by the learned Preceptors
of the Great Archive. These Archives are peaceful institutions dedicated to the spread of practical knowledge and useful engineering to the wider cosmos. Their
large numbers of educated personnel make advanced
equipment more practical for deployment.
Effect: Purchasing an asset that requires tech level 4 or
more costs one fewer FacCred than normal. The
Preceptor Archive may also take the special action
“Teach Planetary Population”, costing 2 FacCreds
and allowing them to roll 1d12 for one world. On
a 12, the world’s tech level permanently becomes
4 for the purposes and purchases of this faction.
Psychic Academy
Most significant factions are capable of employing psychics, but this faction can actually train their own. They
excel at precise and focused application of the psionic
disciplines, and can get far more out of their available
psychic resources than other factions.
Effect: This faction can provide psionic mentor training to qualified psychics. Once per turn, this fac-

tion can also force a rival faction to reroll any one
d10, whether or not they’re involved in the roll.
Savage
Whether a proud tribe of neoprimitives struggling
against the material limits of their world or a pack of
degenerate tomb world cannibals, this faction is accustomed to surviving without the benefits of advanced
technology and maximizing local resources.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an extra die
when defending with an asset that requires tech
level 0 to purchase.
Scavengers
This faction might live within the wreckage of a tomb
world, salvage the castoffs of some decadent pleasure-world or ply the ruins of an orbital scrapyard.
Whatever their territory, this faction knows how to
find worth amid seemingly useless trash.
Effect: Whenever the faction destroys an asset or has
one of their assets destroyed, they gain 1 FacCred.
Secretive
This faction is marked by elaborate protocols of secrecy and misdirection. It may be split up into numerous
semi-autonomous cells, or consist largely of trained espionage professionals. Finding the assets of such a faction can often be more difficult than destroying them.
Effect: All assets purchased by this faction automatically begin Stealthed. See the list of Cunning assets
for details on Stealth.
Technical Expertise
The faction is staffed by large numbers of expert engineers and scientists. They can turn even the most
unpromising labor pool into superb technicians.
Effect: This faction treats all planets on which they
have a Base of Influence as if they were at least
tech level 4. They can build Starship-type assets
on any world with at least ten thousand occupants.
Theocratic
The faction is fueled by the fierce certainty that God
is with them- and with no one else. The tight and
occasionally irrational obedience that pervades the
organization makes it difficult to infiltrate or subvert
effectively.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an extra d10
when defending against a Cunning attack.
Warlike
There are factions with a military orientation, and then
there are factions that just really love killing things.
Whether or not this faction has developed sophisticated military resources and techniques, the membership
is zealous in battle and has a positive taste for fighting.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional
d10 when making a Force attack.

226• Factions In Your Campaign

Factions In Your Campaign
To create a faction, first decide on the scale of the organization. Many factions are restricted to a single world,
and even the most impressive sector empire rarely
exerts direct control over more than a dozen worlds.
Place the faction’s homeworld and locate any Bases of
Influence it might have on other worlds. A few words
beside each Base describing the form it takes can be
handy in later planning out adventures with the faction.
Next, prioritize the faction’s attributes, deciding
the order in which they focus on Force, Cunning, and
Wealth. Minor factions should have a 4 in their most
important attribute, established planetary governments should have a 6, and regional hegemons should
have an 8. Their second-most important attribute is
one less than their primary, and their tertiary attribute
is three less. You can calculate the faction’s hit points
from that, but normally minor powers will have 15 HP,
major powers will have 29 HP, and sector hegemons
will have 49 HP. Their off-world Bases of Influence
normally have a maximum HP equal to half that.
Give minor powers one asset in their primary attribute and one asset in a different attribute. Give major
powers two assets in their primary attribute, and two
assets in different attributes, and give regional hegemons four assets in their primary and four in others.
Place these assets on the worlds occupied by the faction.
Select an appropriate faction tag for the organization, one fitting their special focus and origins. If the
faction has direct governmental control over one or
more worlds, add Planetary Government tags to them.
Finally, select a Goal for the faction. For your initial three or four sector factions, try to pick goals that
will put them in conflict with each other. If the factions
you make are content to hide from the world and get
along in peace and quiet, they’re unlikely to be terribly
useful as patrons or enemies for the PC group, unless
you intend to enlist the PCs as defenders of some beleaguered group of innocents.

Creating PC Factions

Eventually, it’s likely that a PC is going to accumulate
the necessary power and influence to start their own
faction. Often around 9th level, a PC has gained enough
renown and competence that others will want to serve
them, and they can choose to parlay that into a faction
of their own. This may happen at earlier levels, depending on whether or not the PC has made it a significant
priority to develop their own faction.
Newly-founded factions are fragile, vulnerable
things. They start with a score of 2 in their primary
attribute and 1 in the others, 8 hit points, and one asset
in their primary attribute. The GM may select one faction tag appropriate to the new organization’s nature.
The exact details of a PC’s new faction will depend largely on what the character did to form it. A PC

who organizes a colonial expedition to an uninhabited
world will end up with a faction very different from
that of a PC that starts her own psychic academy. In
general, PCs have to actively work to create their faction. It does not simply arrive as their natural birthright.

Adventures and Factions

The actions of adventurers fall outside the faction turn,
but the consequences of their escapades can translate
into the loss or acquisition of FacCreds, assets, or faction hit points. If the players come up with a scheme to
strike at the leadership of the Brotherhood of the New
Man, success or failure isn’t determined according to
Force attacks or Cunning defenses. Success is determined by the outcome of the adventure itself, and the
group’s ability to overcome the security and obfuscation that surrounds these mad gengineers.
The amount of damage done or benefit given to a
faction by a group’s adventures should be substantial, at
least as much as could be accomplished with a faction
turn. It may not be possible to bring down an interstellar empire by precision strikes and subversion, but the
players should be able to see concrete effects from their
successes. At the very least, the newslines at the end of
each faction turn should include public commentary on
the visible consequences of their actions.
Some players will want to take advantage of the
resources of their factions in the course of their adventures, either bringing along troops or specialists, or
utilizing faction assets on a personal level. This should
be permitted as a general matter; there’s not much fun
in being a colonial governor if you can’t even get a
corporal’s guard of bodyguards to look after you. Faction equipment should also be available in reasonable
amounts. Subordinates are not adventurers, however,
and while they will perform their duties diligently and
well, they won’t willingly take the kind of risks that
adventurers often relish. Faction assets should be an
advantage and a tool for the PCs rather than a crutch.
It may come up that a character wants to withdraw credits from his faction, or donate loot won in the
course of their adventuring. FacCreds translate poorly
into normal credits, as they often represent resources
that don’t liquidate easily into cash. The GM should feel
free to prohibit directly withdrawing cash from a faction if a PC comes to rely on it too heavily. Otherwise,
one FacCred will usually translate into about 100,000
credits worth of cash, with substantially larger returns
if used to make investments, or build things.
Characters can give up to 1d4 x 100,000 credits
to a faction in any one turn, with each 100,000 credits
becoming 1 FacCred. Any more than this in one turn is
wasted due to accounting inefficiency, and the faction
will need to spend a full turn processing the donation
before it becomes FacCreds.

Example Factions •227

Example Factions
A GM doesn’t always have time to sort out the details
of every faction that might be needed. A group might
decide to attack the planetary government of a world
that wasn’t important or interesting enough to merit
the effort to define its governmental faction during
sector creation, for example. The following sample
factions can be pulled and used for such places as necessary. Where appropriate, you can add the Planetary
Government tag for legitimate world governments.
Colony World
Thinly-populated worlds with limited infrastructure
tend to have weak colonial governments concerned
chiefly with issues of basic survival rather than expansion or intrigue.
Attributes: Force 4, Cunning 3, Wealth 1
Hit Points: 15
Assets: Guerrilla Populace/Force 2 and Saboteurs/Cunning 2
Tags: Colonists
Lost World
Primitive and barbaric by the standards of the space going worlds, a lost world lacks the technical resources of
their neighbors, but may well have substantial advantages in population and cultural cohesion depending on
the world’s habitability.
Attributes: Force 4, Cunning 1, Wealth 3
Hit Points: 15
Assets: Zealots/Force 3, Harvesters/Wealth 1
Tags: Savage
Backwater Planet
Perhaps this world was important once, but disaster,
ennui, or the Scream has left it a sleepy planet disinterested in the wider galaxy. Most worlds with ordinary
levels of technology in a sector will fit this template.
Attributes: Force 6, Cunning 3, Wealth 5
Hit Points: 29
Assets: Postech Infantry/Force 4, Planetary Defenses/
Force 6, Informers/Cunning 1, Bank/Wealth 4
Tags: Deep Rooted
Zealous Faith
This religious organization is a powerful force in the
sector, likely with major congregations on several
worlds.
Attributes: Force 3, Cunning 6, Wealth 5
Hit Points: 29
Assets: Demagogue/Cunning 6, Organization Moles/
Cunning 5, Zealots/Force 3, Marketers/Wealth 5
Tags: Theocratic

Regional Hegemon
This world is the mightiest military power in the sector
and leads a half-dozen neighboring worlds in a “voluntary confederation” that it ever seeks to expand.
Attributes: Force 8, Cunning 5, Wealth 7
Hit Points: 49
Assets: Space Marines/Force 7, Planetary Defenses/
Force 6, Blockade Fleet/Force 5, Extended Theater/Force 4, Pretech Manufactory/Wealth 7,
Shipping Combine/Wealth 4, Tripwire Cells/
Cunning 4, Cyberninjas/Cunning 3
Tags: Imperialists
Mercantile Combine
A star-spanning consortium of merchants might operate out of one particular world, but their final loyalty
is always to their credit balance.
Attributes: Force 3, Cunning 5, Wealth 6
Hit Points: 29
Assets: Venture Capital/Wealth 6, Shipping Combine/
Wealth 4, Hardened Personnel/Forces 2, Blackmail/Cunning 2
Tags: Plutocratic
Eugenics Cult
Some people are born to rule- literally. These eugenics
cults believe that superior breeds of humanity can be
successfully engineered, and that good genetic background legitimizes rule over less “advanced” humans.
Such cults are widely loathed, but the experimental
medical treatment they offer to those who can find
them makes unwilling converts of some.
Attributes: Force 3, Cunning 6, Wealth 5
Hit Points: 29
Assets: Boltholes/Cunning 5, Demagogue/Cunning 6,
Laboratory/Wealth 3, Gengineered Slaves/Force
1
Tags: Eugenics Cult
Rebel Freedom Fighters
Even in the most tyrannical corners of the galaxy, the
human heart yearns for freedom. These factions spring
up in the shadow of oppressive governments. For each
one that is crushed, a new one rises in time.
Attributes: Force 3, Cunning 4, Wealth 1
Hit Points: 15
Assets: Seditionists/Cunning 4, Zealots/Force 3
Tags: Secretive

228• Example of Faction Play

An Example of Faction Play
The GM has just finished brewing up her initial sector.
She has a rough sketch of the worlds, she’s fleshed out
the planet where the initial play session will occur, and
she’s ready to run the game. She thinks it’d be nice to
have some background activity going on, so she plans
to create three factions to decorate her world.
She picks out three groups that are likely to be
significant players in this corner of her sector: the harsh
planetary government of Typhon, the initial starting
point for the game, the Rathskeller Combine, a multistellar megacorp based off the world of Danube in
the neighboring solar system, and the Way of Voth, a
pretech-worshiping cult with a hidden base on Singularity, a gas giant moon in a system neighboring both.
These aren’t the only possible factions in the system, of course, but they’re the ones most likely to be
pertinent to PC interests. If the PCs move on, she might
retire some of these factions to bring in new ones. She
knows she shouldn’t have more than a half-dozen factions active at once unless she’s ready to do a lot of
tracking during each faction turn.
She knows the Typhon government is a fairly
powerful faction, having effective control of its home
planet save for some plucky rebels against its autocratic
monarchy. Force is its strongest tool, so she gives it a
rating of 6 in that, followed by Wealth of 5 and Cunning of 3. Its maximum hit points are 29. As a major
power, it has two Force assets and two more assets of
any kind. Typhon would love to have Pretech Infantry
and has the Force score to support it, but its tech level
is 4, too low for such advanced troops. It settles for a
Strike Fleet and some Postech Infantry. Aside from that,
it has a government Monopoly on spike drive components and a Postech Industry that helps make them.
It also has a Base of Influence on its home world of
Typhon that automatically has 29 hit points, the same
as the faction itself. Finally, it has the faction tag of
Planetary Government, because it’s the legitimate ruler
of Typhon.
For the Rathskeller Combine, the GM decides that
it’s about as powerful as the Typhon government due
to its far-flung mercantile connections. On reflection,
she thinks its main money comes from its control of
the ship-building industry outside the Typhon system,
which makes it an economic competitor with the staterun Typhon shipyards. She gives it a Wealth rating of
6, Force of 5, and Cunning of 3, with a maximum HP
of 29. Since it’s starship-centric, she gives it Shipping
Combine and Blockade Runner assets for Wealth, and
other assets of Elite Skirmishers and Saboteurs. The
Plutocratic tag fits its mercantile origins.
For the final faction, the GM decides to make
them a relatively weak group, one that tries to use its
limited supplies of pretech artifacts to manipulate “less
developed” societies. She gives it a Cunning score of

4, a Wealth of 3, and a Force of 1. Its maximum hit
points are 15. It gets only two assets as a minor power,
so goes with Cyberninjas and Covert Shipping to get
those ninjas where they need to go. The GM mulls over
the faction tags, but none seem to be quite right. She
decides to give it her own tag of “Pretech Stores”, letting it treat Singularity as a tech level 5 world for purposes of buying high-tech assets there. While there’s no
other meaningful authority on the gas giant moon, the
GM doesn’t think it’s proper to give them the Planetary
Government tag because there really isn’t anything else
on Singularity except the Vothite base. They don’t have
the implicit military power to prevent hostile military
assets from landing on the world, so they don’t really
fit the mold of the Planetary Government tag.
The last step in creating the factions is to give each
of them an initial goal. She decides that the Rathskeller
Combine is really interested in breaking into Typhon’s
closed market. She gives it the Expand Influence goal,
which rewards it when it can found a Base of Influence
on another planet. Typhon is a violent, expansionistic
power that goes in for Blood the Enemy, so it seeks to
inflict hit point damage on rival assets equal to the sum
of its attributes, or 14 points. The Vothites know they
can’t survive a direct confrontation with either important power, so they want to get ready to make a move
when they’re stronger; they choose Peaceable Kingdom,
needing to spend four consecutive turns without taking
an Attack action.
With this established, the GM is ready to run the
first faction turn.

Turn One

The GM randomly selects the Rathskeller Combine to
go first, followed by Typhon, and then the Vothites.
First, the Combine earns its income for the turn;
half its Wealth plus a quarter of its total Force and Cunning, rounded down. That means 5 FacCreds.
Next, it pays maintenance. It has no assets that
require maintenance and hasn’t got more assets of any
one type than its corresponding attribute, so it has no
maintenance cost. If it were to accumulate four Cunning assets, however, while only having a Cunning of
3, it would have to pay one FacCred for each over the
limit. Bases of Influence don’t count for this purpose.
Now the Combine has to decide what action to
take. It knows that Typhon is itching for a fight. The
Combine is nervous about their rival’s Strike Fleet,
but that seems to be the only force that immediately
threatens them. The Postech Infantry that Typhon has
doesn’t have any practical way to cross into Danubian
space unless Typhon buys some sort of transport asset.
Right now there seems no way for the Typhonians
to do that, so the Combine decides to go for a long
economic game, taking the Buy Asset action to spend 2

Example of Faction Play •229
FacCreds on Harvesters. The GM decides that this represents a new flotilla of asteroid mining tugs. A faction
can buy only one asset per turn and can take only one
action, so the Combine’s turn is over.
Typhon isn’t wasting any time. It gets its FacCred
income for the turn of 4 FacCreds and uses its action to
Use Asset Ability to let its Strike Fleet enter the Danube
system. Some assets require governmental permission
to move them into a system with an existing government, but not Strike Fleets. They tend to make their
own permission. Typhon would like to start attacking
Combine assets, but it can only take one action per turn,
so it will have to wait until the next one to open fire.
The Vothites are keeping their head down, accruing their 2 FacCreds. As poor as they are, they need
to do something about it, so they invest in a Buy Asset action to get a Harvester. The GM decides that it
represents scavenger teams dispatched to loot vital
resources from the dangerous pretech caches hidden
on Singularity.
As the final step, the GM translates these faction
actions into newsfeed stories to share with the PCs.
She scribbles up short news blasts about “Typhon First
Fleet Dispatched to Suppress Piracy in the Danube System”, “Rathskeller Combine Commissions New Wing
of Asteroid Miners”, and “Unusual Ship Traffic In Singularity System”. These stories may not have the whole
truth about affairs, but they’re what the PCs would find
out from the local news organizations.

Turn Two

The PCs completed their first adventure and are busy
swanning around in the Danube system. Nothing
they’ve done directly impinges on the local factions,
so the GM simply runs the next faction turn after the
session is over. Random rolls give Voth the first action,
then Typhon, and then the Combine.
Voth gets another 2 FacCreds and dutifully uses
Buy Asset to get another Harvester, scaling up their salvage efforts. This makes two Wealth assets that Voth
has; it can get one more Wealth asset before it starts to
have to pay maintenance on any additional ones. They
would’ve liked to have used Use An Asset to see if their
existing Harvester made them any money, but they
can’t take two different actions during the same turn,
so they must wait for now.
Typhon now collects its 4 FacCreds, for a total of
8, and uses the Attack action. If it had multiple assets in
position, it could attack with all of them; as it stands,
only the Strike Fleet is in the same location as a rival
power. It aims at the Base of Influence, but the Combine gets to decide which asset the Strike Fleet engages.
It chooses to defend with its Blockade Runners. The
Strike Fleet’s Attack is Force versus Force, so Typhon
rolls 1d10 and adds its Force rating for a score of 11.
Against this, the Combine rolls 1d10 and adds its own
Force rating for a score of 12. The Strike Fleet’s attack
has failed, and it takes the Counterattack damage of the

Blockade Runners, for 2d4 damage, for 7 points. The
Strike Fleet is now down to 1 hit point.
The Rathskeller Combine now senses an opportunity. They collect their income of 5 FacCreds for a total
of 8 and take an Attack action of their own, ordering
the Saboteurs to press the attack. The Strike Fleet is the
only viable target in the sector, so Typhon is forced to
defend with it. The Saboteurs’ attack is Cunning versus
Cunning. The Combine rolls an 8, a tepid result, while
the Strike Fleet gets lucky and rolls a 9. The Saboteurs
are forced to take the Strike Fleet’s counterattack damage of 1d8, and roll a 6; they are wiped out. Stung, the
Combine throws the Elite Skirmishers into the fray,
the only other asset they have that even has an attack.
They roll a Force vs. Force attack, Typhon rolls badly,
and the Strike Fleet is destroyed.
The GM then writes up the news blasts for the
session, describing how “pirate” boarding parties destroyed the Typhonian strike fleet by taking advantage
of security breaches caused by recently-discovered saboteurs. She decides that both Danube and Typhon want
to avoid outright war, and that Danube’s planetary government won’t get involved so long as Typhon is only
cutting down Combine holdings.

Turn Three

As it turns out, the PCs took notice of that news item
about Singularity’s ship activity and decided to investigate. In the course of their adventure they killed a
Vothite salvage crew and snatched away a precious haul
of pretech artifacts that the crew had been recovering.
The GM decides that this costs the Vothites one of their
two Harvester assets. There is no die roll or faction action related to this; the PCs did it, so it simply happens.
They also left plenty of evidence, so the GM makes a
note to have a Vothite cyberninja come after them and
their stolen artifacts. Such small-scale actions related to
PC adventures don’t require a full faction action, so the
Vothites don’t need to use an Attack action to go after
the troublesome PCs.
The Vothites go first this round and are not
amused. They collect their 2 FacCreds and Use An
Ability to see if their remaining Harvester makes them
any money; they roll a 4 on its ability and gain an extra
FacCred, for a total of 3 in its coffers this turn.
Typhon goes next, collecting 4 FacCreds for a total
of 12. It’s licking its wounds, but at least it managed to
inflict 6 of the necessary 14 points of damage on a foe
to succeed at its Blood the Enemy goal. It uses Buy Asset
to buy a new Strike Fleet, reconstituting it from the
survivors and spending all 12 FacCreds on it.
The Combine goes last, and is at a crossroads. Their
income this turn gives them 13 FacCreds and they’ve
successfully destroyed a Typhionian Strike Fleet, but
it cost them their Saboteurs, and they have only one
asset left that can even attack at all. What should they
do to address the Typhonian menace? Maybe some PC
mercenaries might tip the scales for them…

GAME MASTER RESOURCES
The following pages include a number of tables for the
quick generation of NPCs, patrons, names, place names,
and quick encounters. The tables are in no way intended to be exhaustive or particularly detailed. They are
simply quick conveniences for the GM to spare constant reference to the internet or other books to nail
down the basic flavoring of their NPCs.
Aside from these tables, this section also discusses
some of the more common issues that arise for GMs
of Stars Without Number. PC death, the role of combat,
when to use skill checks, how to handle investigations,
and other potentially sticky elements are reviewed and
advice given for the practical handling of these matters.
In addition, this chapter gives some guidelines on
converting material from the first edition of the game
to the current revised rules. A selection of potential
house rules are also suggested for groups that wish to
customize their game a little more.
When applying any of these guidelines or suggestions, however, it is important that you remember a
critical thing about running the game at your table.

Your Game and Your Group

The most important thing you can remember as a GM
running Stars Without Number is that you are running
it for a specific group of people. You are not running it
for a generic Typical Gamer, you are running it for Bob
and Eunice and Feng and Tyler. There is no genericized
advice that can be applied to your specific group that is
nearly as helpful as your own powers of social expertise
and your personal knowledge of the table.
Game designers sometimes fall into the trap of
trying to force social outcomes at the table through
specific game rules. These rules can encourage certain
outcomes in the general case, but they cannot compel
results. They are certainly not nearly as effective in producing an outcome as you, the GM, can be, because
these rules can’t know your players as well as you do.
Whenever you consider making a house rule, or
adding a tweak to the game, or even basic considerations of what kind of sandbox excitement you should
be offering to your players, you must always think
about the specific players you have. Don’t worry about
the Typical Gamer. The Typical Gamer is not at your
table. If Bob really wants a new focus that allows his PC
to do a particular trick, you do not need to think of all
the ways a Typical Gamer could abuse or misuse that
new power. You need to think of the ways Bob could
misuse it. Maybe he is the kind of gamer who would be
very disruptive to the game with the ability, and maybe
you know how he plays well enough to tell that he’d
never cause a problem with it. The same ability that
would be absolutely terrible in the hands of some players can be perfectly safe in the hands of others. Only
you can reasonably tell which is which.

The same general attitude is necessary towards
other elements of your campaign, not just the house
rules. You need to think about how your specific players are likely to react to plot hooks, campaign elements,
and new additions to the game. If you know Eunice
was bored out of her mind by an adventure session
that revolved around trading, it’s probably a bad idea
to offer her hooks that focus on commercial dealings,
or at least talk it over with her outside the game before
you introduce it to make sure there’s something about
the hook that she can find engaging.
As the GM, you already have a lot of responsibility
on your shoulders. You have the adventures to create,
the sandbox to populate, and the game itself to run. It
is very unlikely that you have the energy or the time
to worry about creating universally-functional house
rules and generalized systems. That is the game designer’s job. It’s up to me to give you general rules that will
work well in most situations and provide serviceable
results with the Typical Gamer. That kind of averaged-out design is necessary if you’re to be provided
with a basic toolbox of useful mechanics and systems.
But you can do better, because you know your
audience. You know what they want, what they’re
interested in, and how they’re likely to use the tools
you hand them. You can create specific house rules and
case-by-case permissions that mold your game to fit the
needs and interests of your own table.
Stars Without Number is designed in the spirit of
old-school gaming, where these sort of house rules and
campaign-specific systems are totally acceptable and
perfectly normal. This game is not a delicate flower
that will wilt if you touch it the wrong way. It is built
on a basic mechanical chassis more than forty years old,
a veritable AK-47 of game design, and it can take an
incredible amount of punishment and careless handling
without breaking. You will not ruin your game by adding in house rules that make sense to you.
This game belongs to you and your players. As
the designer, I only get a vote in how things should be;
the ultimate decision is always with you and your play
group. Only you properly understand the goals of your
group and the kind of fun you want to have, and only
you and your players can provide the definitive understanding of your ultimate aim. I am providing you with
a basic structure that will work for most groups, but it’s
up to you to add the chrome or tweaks that you want.
Perhaps you won’t need to add any. It may well be
that the rules exactly as written serve your purpose just
fine, and you have no particular desire to tweak them.
If that’s the case, then that’s fine. But you should never
be afraid to reach in and adjust things to improve your
own play. Add systems from other old-school-inspired
games, brew up your own rules, or excise bits that don’t
fit. This game is yours, and you should play it your way.

232• Complications

Common Game Master Complications
Once you’ve successfully created your sector and gathered the players, you might find a few difficulties cropping up in the course of play. There are certain pitfalls
and complications that are particular to the style of play
that Stars Without Number encourages, and it’s helpful
to have an idea beforehand of how to deal with them.

Death

Characters in Stars Without Number die easily. The
average third-level psychic might well be taken out
by a lucky pistol round, and even high-level warriors
don’t have more than 60 or 70 hit points. It’s true that
biopsionics and lazarus patches can revive characters
that get medical help in time, but there are plenty of
situations where there’s just not time to save a teammate or the attempt proves a failure. If the rules are
used as written, PCs who regularly put themselves in
dangerous situations are going to die.
You and your players should decide at the start of
the game how you want to deal with this. For maximum old-school authenticity, you might mutually decide to just let the dice fall where they may. If Captain
Spaulding plunges into the sulfur volcanoes of Badghati
IV, the high-level veteran of dozens of daring interstellar escapades gets a touching space memorial and
his player rolls up a replacement. This is the default
assumption of the game, and it can add a great deal of
excitement and reward to the sensation of navigating
a character through lethal challenges.
It can also really aggravate players who enjoy
building deeply-involved PCs with many close ties to
the game world and its characters. A GM can decide to
omit the risk of death in most cases, reducing PCs with
0 hit points to “gravely wounded” status and allowing
them to be revived with medical attention. Some situations might run the risk of real death, but the GM
can save this for occasions of genuine dramatic importance. There’s nothing at all wrong with this approach
to death, and it can help some players focus on the story
that they and their group are creating rather than living
in fear of every goon with a combat rifle.
Of course, there are shades of gray between these
two extremes, and most GMs come to inhabit some
point on this spectrum. There are many ways the GM
can lessen the risk of death without out-and-out denying it. In particular, the GM can cause enemies to
spread their attacks over a group rather than focusing
on the weakest PC. Hostiles can pay more attention to
the warriors in the group rather than the experts or
psychics, especially when the Warrior has yet to use his
class ability to negate a hit. You can take care not to include instant-death traps or devices in your adventures,
or fabricate situations where a character’s life hinges on
a single die roll. You can include substantial numbers
of NPC henchmen and companions in an adventure,

and let them soak up a portion of the danger. All of
these tactics can be used to tacitly lessen the danger of
character death without taking it off the table.
Sooner or later, however, it’s likely that some PC is
going to kick the bucket. At that point, it becomes necessary to get a replacement into the action. The replacement PC should be added as quickly as possible, and it
can often be advantageous for players to roll up these
replacements before the game even starts, so they have
a character in hand should their former PC catch a bad
case of laser poisoning. Creating the characters beforehand also allows the group to set up ties of association
that help justify why they’re suddenly willing to include
the new PC in their adventures. These replacements
can be members of the crew of the ship they’re travelling on, outworlders slouching around the local bars,
wanderers gone native among the locals, or prisoners
of whatever nefarious group the party is fighting. The
key factor is to get the replacement into action quickly,
so the player who’s lost his or her PC isn’t punished
with inactivity at the table as well as PC loss.
It’s generally easiest to have the replacement PC
be the same level as the dead PC. For high-level adventures, it’s distressingly likely that a low-level PC would
die quickly when facing challenges of that caliber. If
they do come in at a lower level, you’re going to have
to make some allowances when it comes time for them
to gain experience points. If everyone is gaining points
at the same rate, the lower-level PC will never catch
up; you may want to give them a bonus after each adventure to ensure that eventually they match the same
level of competence as the rest of the crew.

Skill Checks

Skill checks are susceptible to overuse. Some GMs end
up forcing a skill check on everything more complicated than tying your bootlaces, or prohibit PCs from
even hoping to accomplish a feat for which they lack
the appropriate skill. Skill checks are not meant to be
the sole way that a PC gets something accomplished
in the world.
You should be charitable about the things a character can accomplish without a skill check. If an Expert’s
concept is that of a crack spaceship pilot with a Dexterity modifier of +2 and Pilot-2 skill, you shouldn’t be
expecting him to make skill checks to operate the ship
under normal conditions. He can take off, he can land,
he can get to places in the system without bothering
with skill checks. Even someone with Pilot-0 should
likely be able to do as much, except the expert pilot
can do it without a check even amid high winds and
low visibility. Let the PCs be good at their chosen focus.
Don’t spam skill checks. If a character is trying
to repair a fusion power plant while under fire from
badlands raiders, don’t turn it into a roll-each-turn ex-

Complications •233
travaganza to determine how far he progresses in his
attempt. Let him roll once, with a failure meaning either that he can’t do it in the available time or that he’ll
need another 1d6 rounds before he can bring the defense laser power plant online. Give him player choices
each turn, like deciding whether to bring a laser online
early and risk a short in the wiring. Let a single skill
check indicate the general course of success or failure,
but then let the PC make additional choices rather than
additional rolls. Rolls can only add so much tension,
and tension alone does not guarantee engagement with
a situation.
Don’t require a skill check unless failing it means
something. If a character can simply keep trying at
something with no real negative consequences, it’s
not worth a skill check. They’ll get it sooner or later,
so it’s easiest to just tell them that it was successful. If
time is important and there’s a significant difference
between accomplishing it instantly or accomplishing it
soon, just follow a failed skill check with a roll of 1d6
and assume that many rounds, minutes, or hours go by
before the PC finally gets it right.
Don’t ignore actions taken outside of skill checks.
If a character jams a titanium wrecking bar into the
cogs of an alien death trap, you probably shouldn’t require him to make a successful Fix roll to disable the device. What he’s done will objectively work, and there’s
no point or need in rolling for it. If there’s a casket
of luminous Mettauan glass underneath the senator’s
bed, then the players will find it if they look under the
bed, and no Notice check is needed to see if they notice
it. Skill checks are best used to reflect the results of a
complicated or uncertain attempt at an action. If the
PC tries something that anyone can do and that would
have an obvious result, then just let the result happen.
Don’t use a skill check unless the outcome is unclear.

Combat

Combat in Stars Without Number tends to be fairly lethal. One good roll by a pistol-wielding thug can take
out almost any first level character, and characters never really scale to the point where they can afford to hold
enemies in contempt. You should take care to structure
your adventures and situations so that PCs are very
rarely forced into fights. The shotguns and laser rifles
should come out either because the PCs have chosen
to use them or because they’re facing the consequences
of their own missteps.
Because combat is so dangerous, it’s vital to allow the PCs to set it up on their own terms, assuming
they’re cunning and prudent enough to take advantage
of their opportunities. Ambushes, AC bonuses for cover, and the use of the environment to hurt and baffle
their foes should all be encouraged. If a character wants
to use an element of the environment to do something
interesting, let them. “You do that, and nothing happens.” is rarely a good answer for any halfway plausible
PC action.

Enemies should also be played as their morale indicates. A pack of street thugs will not transform into
Spartans at Thermopylae, dying to the last man to
prevent the PCs from discovering their gang hideout.
Even trained and disciplined combatants are going to
have serious thoughts about retreat as soon as their
comrades start dying. Only when enemies feel trapped
or are defending something as precious to them as their
lives will they normally fight to the last.

Negotiation and Diplomacy

There is a Talk skill, and the fact that this and similar
social skills exist sometimes causes players or GMs to
simply shut off more informal evaluations of social
situations. When the PC wants to convince an NPC
of something, they roll Cha/Talk and let the dice tell
them how far the NPC is willing to buy their premise.
The actual words and arguments they use are simply
decorations to the event.
On one level, this is justifiable. The player of the
Warrior isn’t expected to be a real-life shootist to roll
a good attack roll, so why should the player of the silver-tongued Expert con man have to come up with
a smooth line of patter to use his own abilities? It’s
legitimate and reasonable to let the dice determine the
success of a conversational gambit. If a player has spent
character resources on something like social skills, they
should see a mechanical benefit from it. Moreover, relying on a player’s conversational talents to move negotiations can often boil down to a game of finding the
right conversational gambit for the GM rather than
rationally persuading the NPC.
Still, some players and GMs prefer to let actual
argumentation play a bigger role. One potential way to
do this is to let the player state his or her case, and then
set the Talk check difficulty accordingly. Convincing a
crime boss to give a PC access to his network of corrupt
city officials might be a difficulty 8 test if the player
makes a good argument for it, while a desultory request
might be difficulty 10. Alternately, you might implicitly
adjust the consequences of success or failure based on
the character’s total Charisma and skill bonus. A character with a +5 total might not succeed in persuading
the crime boss if they roll very low, but he’ll point them
towards someone who might be able to help them. The
key for this sort of approach is to let both skills and
player argumentation have a visible effect on the outcome, so that players feel that both matter.
In either case, you should make clear to the group
which model will be used when they’re making up their
characters. It prevents difficulty later when the player
running the character with a -1 Charisma modifier and
no social skills expects his own glib tongue to carry the
day with NPCs.

234• Complications

Searching and Investigation

Many adventures rely on the party solving a mystery
or unearthing the dark truths behind some enigmatic event. PCs can occasionally get frustrated by these
adventures when they feel that they’ve hit a dead end
or are presented with a set of clues that they, the players, can’t hope to puzzle out. Conversely, players can
sometimes grow bored when the adventures become
a sequence of skill tests, with the PCs simply trying to
roll high so that the GM will let them advance.
Running a good investigation-based adventure
can be difficult, but there are a few tactics that can be
useful to a GM. First, identify those pieces of information that must be found in order to solve the puzzle.
Cracking the secret organlegging ring run out of the
city’s child protective services department might hinge
on identifying the secret lab in which the organs are
harvested, the corrupt CPS chief who hides the goods
in her home, and the crooked physician who launders
the organs into the donor system. These three facts
have to be discovered in order for the PCs to progress.
Once you’ve established the facts, watch for opportunities to let them be discovered. Drawn in by the
hook of a recurring urchin NPC they knew who vanished after being picked up by protective services, the
PCs might check out the NPC’s old haunts or associates,
only to learn that a number of street kids have gone
missing after CPS collected them, and that all of them
were picked up by a particular agent. Don’t make the
discovery of vital information hinge on a die roll. If
the PCs take rational investigative steps, they should
be given something to show for it, even if it’s just the
confidence that their current route is a dead end. You
should be trying to give out this information when the
PCs give you an excuse to do so, rather than hoarding
it against all but precisely correct lines of investigation.
You also shouldn’t feel bad about giving PCs a
break if they start to flail, either by introducing a helpful NPC to put them back on the trail or remind them
of some earlier point they didn’t fully investigate. By
the same token, you shouldn’t hesitate to let them deal
with the consequences of tardiness. If they spend too
long in distractions before finding their urchin friend,
they might discover nothing more than spare parts.
One particular point that often comes up is the
question of searching an area. Some GMs just let the
PCs all make Notice checks to see if they notice something hidden. This has the advantage of being quick
and simple, but it also can put vital information at the
mercy of good dice. Other GMs require the players to
specifically say what parts of an area they’re searching,
what they’re looking under or inside, and otherwise
describe the specifics of their search. This can penalize
players who don’t correctly envision the area the GM
is describing. One compromise is to simply give players
vital clues when they say that they are searching, and
then use one or both of the other methods to let them
search for supplementary facts and helpful details.

Salvage

The far future is full of expensive decor. Truly enterprising PCs sometimes are of a mind to “salvage” a place
down to its foundations, ripping out everything that
can be resold and trucking it all off to be converted into
credits. To some extent, this is simply common sense;
no red-blooded freebooter would simply leave unclaimed valuables lying around when he knows they’ll
fetch a good price at the starport. Still, it can be tedious
to handle the logistics of salvage and unbalancing to the
game to allow PCs to cash in on every alien fork and
wall panel they can drag back to civilization.
The easiest way to deal with this is to simply make
clear that most non-portable valuables the PCs might
salvage are just too difficult to move on the secondary
market. Questions of legal ownership, finding a suitably indiscriminate buyer, and avoiding tax scrutiny all
combine to make such efforts more trouble than they’re
worth. It can be interesting to make an adventure out of
moving some particularly exceptional piece of salvage,
but as a general rule, it’s just not worth it to strip the
copper wiring out of a crime boss’ hideout.
There is also the issue of PCs methodically stripping the armor, weapons, and pocket change from their
dead foes. In most cases this is self-limiting, as most
PCs can’t easily pack around a half-dozen combat rifles
while engaged in the kind of pursuits that leave them
fighting their former owners. In the unlikely case that
the PCs come back with a cargo sled, most of the armor is probably worthless due to the perforations that
killed its wearer and the weaponry is unlikely to be so
valuable as to unbalance the game. Even in that case,
moving the weapons on the black market is usually not
a trivial enterprise. You shouldn’t discourage PCs from
upgrading their own equipment from the plunder of
the fallen or taking exceptionally valuable pieces for later fencing, but you shouldn’t feel obligated to let them
decamp with the battlefield on their backs.
The actual mechanics of selling plunder can be as
complicated as you wish to make them. It may be that
what the PCs retrieve can be sold openly on the world,
usually for around half its purchase value if a quick sale
is desired. Something closer to full price can only be obtained with the sort of patience, contacts, and attention
that adventurers rarely have avaialble.
A fence might be needed for those goods which
were acquired in illicit fashion, or items that are outlawed for common trade. Fences rarely pay more than
ten or twenty percent of an item’s purchase price. Many
such difficulties can be removed by taking the loot offworld and laundering it somewhere beyond the reach
of the planet’s laws.

Complications •235

Interstellar Trade
As an extension of this, some groups will want to make
a killing in interstellar trade, carrying the goods of one
world to another to make a fast credit. This is a venerable science-fiction trope, and there’s no reason you
shouldn’t allow it, but there are a few considerations
to keep in mind when dealing with space commerce.
Perhaps most importantly, there is no such thing
as interstellar bulk shipping in Stars Without Number.
Even the largest spike drive ships have cargo capacities
measured in a few tens of thousands of tons, while a
modern oil tanker has a capacity of around 500,000
tons. Trying to run a meaningful trade in bulk commodities has been a lost cause ever since the jump gates
failed and massive system-ship freighters could no longer make the jump between worlds. Such commerce
can exist inside a system, with huge slowboats moving
from planet to planet, but modern trade relies on carrying small loads of high-value goods or expert services.
Most small merchant ships such as the ones a PC
group is likely to own rely on in-system supply runs as
their bread and butter. They cart loads of food, water,
replacement personnel, spare parts, and other life support supplies out to remote asteroid mines, research
stations, and extraction plants. The pay is rarely much,
but such supply run missions are excellent hooks for
dropping a group into the middle of some disaster.
Trade beyond supply runs usually revolves around
moving local specialty tech or products. Local art, exotic pharmaceuticals, high-quality technical specialties, or
passengers with special skills who want to reach a particular world all make up this class of trade. For most
purposes, it’s not necessary to really elaborate on the
specifics of this, though it can add flavor to make up a
product or two unique to a given world.
There are also exceptionally risky trading expeditions to lostworlders, bringing the fruits of modern
postech to their benighted nations. While the weaponry, pharmaceuticals, and technical artifacts are usually
greedily desired on these worlds, the natives often have
very little of value to pay for them. Explorer-merchants
often have to investigate a lostworlder culture carefully
before they can identify any particular product or resource that can be usefully shipped interstellar distances to justify the trip. Some particularly unscrupulous
merchants do not balk at taking payment in local slaves
for export to decadent or dangerous worlds.
There are also “missionary” supply runs to these
primitive worlds. The Preceptors of the Great Archive
occasionally run missions on a planet to disseminate
valuable technical and artistic knowledge among the
locals, and there are always a selection of determined
missionaries bent on bringing the word of their faith to
the heathens. While these missions normally can supply their own food, offworld medicine and spares are
vital for keeping their more advanced tech operating.

More sinister than the Preceptors and the pious
are the “Kurtzes”. The prospect of ruling like a god on
some forgotten world lures a certain type of men and
women, a type that might normally be forced to limit
their dark ambitions on a more technically advanced
world, where energy weapons and powered armor
do not give a person so vast an advantage over their
peers. These Kurtzes seek out lost worlds with other
like-minded men and women, usually framing their
ambitions as a matter of “bringing advancement to the
primitives”. Most Kurtz expeditions collapse in blood
and horror within a few years, but some manage to
hold on for far longer.

Quick Trade Rules

For those who prefer not to use the full-fledged rules
for interstellar trade provided in the Suns of Gold supplement, here are a few quick guidelines for responding
to player interest in interstellar trade. They assume the
PCs have a ship, but are just scrounging for marginal
shipments and fast opportunities rather than taking
advantage of a formal trade network and steady, reliable work contracts.
First, let the PCs find a deal for some good that the
planet might reasonably produce. Cheap bulk goods
would run for 2d6 x 10 credits per ton, ordinary finished goods go for 2d6 x 100 credits per ton, and hightech, expensive products are 2d6 x 1,000 credits per ton.
They can find a new deal with a week’s wait.
PCs can try to improve the purchase price with
a Cha/Trade skill check opposed by the seller’s Wis/
Trade skill roll. On a success, the price decreases by 10%
times the level of Trade skill the bargainer has. On a
failure, the price remains firm.
Before the goods are loaded, roll 1d6. If the PCs
tried to get a better price, subtract 1 from the roll. If
the result is 1 or less, something has gone wrong and
the goods are lost, stolen, confiscated, or fake. The PCs
are going to have to either eat the loss or take whatever
adventurous steps are necessary to get their money or
goods back. These steps may involve gunfire.
When the PCs try to sell the goods, assuming the
planet might reasonably want them, roll 2d6+1 and
multiply it by 10 for bulk goods, 100 for finished manufactures, or 1,000 for expensive goods. This is the base
price the buyer offers to the PCs. They can bargain for
better with the same opposed check as before, gaining
a 10% price increase per Trade skill level on a success.
On a failure, the PCs have to accept the offered price.
After the sale is finalized, the 1d6 needs to be rolled
again, also with a -1 penalty if a better price was sought.
On a result of 1 or less, the sale end of things goes awry,
and the PCs are out both money and goods. To salvage
them, they’ll need to conduct some sort of adventure
revolving around reclaiming their rightful due.

236• Converting First Edition

Converting First Edition Stars Without Number
Most of this edition’s content can be used interchangeably with first edition Stars Without Number. Characters may be created somewhat differently, starships
might handle combat in a new way, and psionics might
have changed, but the end result largely uses the same
statistics and same score ranges. An original-edition
Stars Without Number character can adventure in a revised-edition campaign without requiring much in the
way of special rules.
Some GMs will want guidelines on converting an
existing original-edition game to the current edition.
This is a simple process, as the scales are the same.

Converting Characters

Characters have the same attributes, character level,
and all other scores unless specified otherwise. Skills
are converted directly into the closest equivalent; Combat/Projectile becomes Shoot, and so forth. In the case
of multiple skills now compressed into a single skill,
like a PC with both Combat/Projectile and Combat/
Energy, the highest skill is converted and the lower
skills can be exchanged for any other skills of the same
level of the player’s choice.
PCs retain their class. Hit points are re-rolled for
the character based on their revised-edition hit die.
Thus, a 5th level Psychic can reroll 5d6 for their hit
points. PCs may keep their existing hit point totals if
the new roll is lower.
PCs may pick a number of foci appropriate to
their class and level. If converting a 2nd level Warrior, for example, the PC could pick their initial focus,
their bonus Warrior focus, and the focus they get at
second level. If they pick foci that grant bonus skills,
apply the bonus as 3 additional skill points to the skill
as described on page 57.
PC experience points are pro-rated based on the
campaign. If the character was halfway to 7th level in
the existing campaign, place their experience points
halfway to 7th level under the revised rules.
Attack bonuses and Armor Class are calculated using the new rules, as are saving throw scores.

Converting Psionics

The rules above are sufficient for converting most PCs,
but the powers of Psychic PCs are a bit trickier.
To get the PC’s psychic skill ratings, take their primary discipline, halve it, and round it up. Take their
other disciplines, halve them, and round down. Thus,
a PC with a primary Telepathy discpline of 9 and secondary disciplines of Metapsionics 7 and Biopsionics
2 would be converted to Telepathy-5, Metapsionics-3
and Biopsionics-1. For disciplines above level-0, they
can pick a free technique from each skill level they
know, plus one additional technique for each discipline
from any level they know. Calculate Effort normally.

Converting Creatures

Flip Armor Classes to ascending values by subtracting
the creature’s AC from 20. No other changes are needed; existing attack bonuses, hit dice, saving throws, and
so forth can be used as written.

Converting Ships

Give NPC ships an appropriate number of Command
Points to use each round in ship combat. Civilian ships
and fighters should have 4 CP, military ships and experienced pirates should have 5 CP, and higher scores
should be reserved for elite or spacer-native crews.
Adjust the ship’s maintenance cost based on the
new six-month maintenance schedule.
Ship statistics such as hit points, speed, Power,
Mass, and other attributes are generally the same in
both editions. If the PCs build a new ship you can check
it against the numbers, but existing ships can be left
unchanged during use.

Converting Equipment

Most equipment and weaponry can be used unchanged,
as they’re the same in both editions. You may need to
use the revised edition version of a particular suit of
armor or treat a monoblade as a medium advanced
weapon rather than a unique type of armament, but
no real conversion is needed.
For melee weapons, give it the appropriate Shock
rating for its size. Small weapons have Shock scores of
1/AC 15, medium weapons have scores of 2/13 AC, and
large weapons have scores of 2/15 AC.
For gear that forces a saving throw on a target,
simply have the victim make whichever saving throw
seems most appropriate to the item’s effect. In case of
Luck saves, substitute Mental saves or a pure blind
chance of 50% success.

Using Existing Sourcebooks

Existing Stars Without Number sourcebooks such as
Suns of Gold, Skyward Steel, Starvation Cheap, and
Darkness Visible can be used with few or no changes.
Most of the resources in these books were designed to
be used in a system-agnostic fashion, and the agency
construction rules in Darkness Visible or the interstellar
trade rules in Suns of Gold can be employed without
altering anything.
In a few cases, these sourcebooks may call for
checks from skills that have been changed in the revised
edition. Simply use the new version’s skill in such cases;
if Suns of Gold tells you to add a PC’s Business score to
some total, just add their Trade score instead.

House Rules •237

House Rules and the Game
Stars Without Number derives from an old-school gaming tradition where house rules were almost universal.
The basic chassis of the game is simple enough and
rugged enough to handle all kinds of tweaks and adjustments without collapsing, and it is your sacred and
inalienable right to bend the game in any direction you
wish if it improves your fun.
You are encouraged to try the rules as-written at
first, though, so you can be sure that you really do want
to change something. If you do decide to shuffle things
around, here are some possible house rules you could
adopt, and some suggestions about their effects.
No Shock Damage: Weapons do not do Shock damage.
This can simplify melee combat at the cost of discouraging PCs from choosing to use melee weapons and increasing the “whiff” factor with them.
If you drop Shock damage, you might also choose
to drop the Snap Attack combat maneuver, as it’s
no longer necessary to give gunslingers a way to
blaze down charging melee attackers before they
get into range.
Use Original Skill Lists: Like the skill list from the original edition of SWN better? Use it instead. When
creating characters, allow skill picks or rolls to
be converted to a corresponding original-edition
skill. If the PC rolls “Shoot”, for example, let them
pick Combat/Gunnery, Combat/Projectile, or
Combat/Energy instead. When the existing rules
call for a particular new skill, let the PC use any old
skill that plausibly matches its function.
Don’t Use Command Points: Don’t want to track Command Points in ship combat? Eliminate all actions
that grant Command Points and just let each PC
pick one action from their department list each
turn. The captain’s Support Department action
now gives that department a bonus action, and
the gunner now has a Fire At A System action that
lets them fire one weapon at a targeted system at
a -4 penalty to hit. NPC ships can either fire all
weapons in a round or fire only one weapon and
take one action relevant to their immediate needs.
No Ranged Weapon Binding: One of the significant
combat differences between the revised edition
of the game and the original is the rule limiting
the use of ranged weapons when a hostile melee
combatant is adjacent. Some GMs will want to
drop this rule for simplicity’s sake, and that can
work, but it may leave melee specialists feeling a
little superfluous.
Use a Grid in Combat: While the game isn’t written
around the use of miniatures and a combat grid,
GMs who want to go to the extra effort of making up such resources can do so. Using two-meter
squares or hexes is likely to give the best results.

Eliminate Psionics: Some GMs who want a more “hard
sci-fi” game might choose to ditch psionics from
the setting. In their absence, the Scream can simply have been an alien energy pulse that shattered
the Jump Gates and left the worlds of humankind
isolated for centuries. If you eliminate psychic PCs,
however, you’ll want to take care that the group
has access to other healing resources, such as stims
and trained PC medics.
Drop FTL Starflight: GMs who want to run a strictly one-solar-system game might eliminate FTL
spaceflight as an option. The Engines of Babylon
supplement for the original game discusses how to
change the starship rules for a TL3 campaign that
has edged into intra-system space flight.
Boost Starting Levels: The default campaign assumes
that PCs will start at first level, as experienced
but extremely mortal heroes. Groups that want
to make room for a little more durability without
using the heroic PC rules in the game’s deluxe version might choose to start at third level instead of
first, or give a flat 10 HP bonus to all PCs.
Add Universal Psionics: A GM might choose to run a
campaign where every PC has some degree of
psionic power. In such games, every PC should
get the bonus of being a Partial Psychic as given
under the Adventurer class. Adventurers who
choose the Partial Psychic option should be treated as full Psychics, and the full Psychic class itself is
dropped. If using the space magic rules in the deluxe game version, the same method can be used
to add universal magic abilities to PCs, either as
partial Magisters, Adepts, or Arcanists.
Use Plot Points: Some groups prefer to have a certain
amount of narrative control given to the PCs, either to save them from otherwise-certain doom or
allow them to make certain statements about the
situation that are automatically true. Under such
circumstances, you might give each PC two “plot
points” that can be spent to save them when they
would otherwise certainly perish, or else make an
adjustment to the current adventuring situation
that the GM judges amenable. Each time the PC
advances a level, these plot points reset. Any unspent ones are lost.
Make Combat a Bloodbath: A few groups like to emphasize the abject horror and murderous danger of
combat in their campaigns. For these groups, you
can add the simple rule that every attack roll made
on an even-numbered round of combat will automatically hit unless there’s a penalty on the roll,
whether due to cover or circumstances. In that
case, the attack is rolled normally. PCs who get
involved in combat thus know they have a very
limited amount of time to resolve the situation.

238• Name Generators

Name Generators
What’s in a name? For most campaigns, a very great
deal. Names and naming conventions are an important
and useful tool for giving your worlds a sense of coherence and verisimilitude. It’s all too easy to fall into
the easy convention of nonsense-syllable names when
a GM can get much more world-building mileage out
of a more thoughtful use of language.
The names of people and places on a world should
be in conformity with the local language. Every world
is going to have its oddball names, but if the great majority of them share the same basic roots, it helps give
the world a sense of cohesion and place. Even when the
players have no knowledge whatsoever of the language
or culture being used as a touchstone, using the same
linguistic roots ensures that the same basic palette of
sounds and word fragments will be used.
Note that language and culture are separable. Just
because you’ve got a world flavored with Arabian-style
architecture and kinship groupings, there’s no reason
you can’t use French or Spanish for the language. A
thousand-odd years in the far future, cultural transmutations unimaginable to us at present have taken
place throughout human space. There no doubt exist centuries-old interstellar cultures that bear only a
vague resemblance to their original forms. Take advantage of this to make your own life easier.

Making Names Memorable

One difficulty that occasionally comes up at the table is
a difficulty in remembering names that don’t have any
grounding in languages spoken by the players. Without any mnemonic hook or familiarity, one string of
polysyllables tends to blur into another.
One way to get around this problem is to attach
strong visual or character cues to individual NPCs.
Players might not remember a particular spaceport
hand’s name, but they’ll remember the guy who’s constantly smoking a reeking cheroot, or the woman with
fiber-optic laced hair. As the GM, you can help prevent
forgetfulness by using the NPC’s name regularly as well.

Creating Alien Names

One quick trick for creating wholly alien names is to
hunt up a very obscure language online and just use
its words to name exotic entities and places. The players are unlikely to recognize Galatian or Gothic, so
you spare yourself from carrying the implicit cultural
baggage of the tongue, but the language still retains a
characteristic set of sounds that will help maintain a
coherent aural landscape. Further “palette swaps” of
vowels, particular consonant clusters or the like can
make an “alien language” out of almost any speech.

One-Roll NPCs

notice. The preceding name generators can be used in
conjunction with these tables to quickly produce a minor fill-in character for your adventure. Simply roll one
of each type of die: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. Match
them to the tables, smooth over any rough joins, and
you have your instant NPC.

possessions might be appropriate for someone in their

One-Roll Patrons •245

One-Roll Patrons
PCs often need patrons to aim them at adventures or
offer suitable recompense for semi-legal favors. In conjunction with the adjacent one-roll NPC tables, you can
use the tools below to quickly generate a patron and
what it is they want from the party.
One particularly convenient technique is to have
a few short filler adventures drawn up as described on
page 177, and then when the players suddenly need
a job or need a favor that only a cooperative patron
could provide, use the patron to hook them up with
the filler adventure. If you lack a convenient premade
adventure, it’s usually most practical to have the patron
request some simple, direct, one-scene job that you feel
comfortable in running on the fly. You can consult page
178 to find appropriate pay rates for different patrons.

246• One-Roll Urban Encounters

One-Roll Urban Encounters
There are inevitably times when a GM needs something to distract the PCs quickly. A quick encounter,
whether in the urban jungles or the alien wastes, can
buy a GM the time they need to puzzle out some larger
problem. The tables here can be used to create a simple
urban event to occupy the PCs for a little while.
The exact details of the event will have to be supplied by the GM in such a way as to fit the planet’s
culture and situation, but the goal of the tables is to
provide a fast conflict that the PCs can interact with
meaningfully. If the PCs resist the hook, it’s a relatively
simple matter to make the avoidance of it enough of a
challenge that it buys you the time you needed in the
first place. Don’t force the PCs to engage with it, but
let them work a little to get free.

One-Roll Wilderness Encounters •247

One-Roll Wilderness Encounters
Building appropriate wilderness encounters will vary
greatly with the planet in question, but the tables below
assume that the wilderness is on an inhabited world
with some vague analogs to Terran terrain and vegetation. If the world is devoid of human inhabitants,
replace the features with alien relics or the remnants
of scouts or lost colonies.
The tables below provide a suggested time of day
and initial distance for the encounter, but these baselines will vary depending on the choices and capabilities
of the PCs. Some encounters are unlikely to occur at
night, unless the parties involved are traveling or otherwise active despite the dark. Suggestions are given
for likely-hostile and likely-friendly creatures, but a
reaction roll will influence attitudes greatly.
